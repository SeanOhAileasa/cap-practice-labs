<h3 id="cn-m21-91"><b>Task 1 - View a Sample Incident Response Plan</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-92">Incident Response is a process that an organization 
uses to handle a cyberattack or security breach. To manage the incident,
 the organization must have an incident response plan that outlines the 
steps that have to be followed by the incident response team in case of a
 cyberattack or data breach.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-93">In this task, you will view a sample incident response plan from the lab.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m21-94"><b><i>Step 1</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m21-108">Close the <b>Incident Response Plan </b>document.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-109"><b>Limiting Communication to Trusted Parties</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-110">Once an incident occurs, communication becomes critical between the stakeholders.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-111">When such a situation arises where you have to deal 
with an incident, you need to ensure that you communicate the correct 
message only with the designated officials or personnel.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-112">There are going to be stakeholders who play different roles.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-113">You need to ensure that you only share the 
information that is necessary for the stakeholder to know. The correct 
piece of information to a specific stakeholder will allow that person to
 focus on the tasks that he or she needs to perform.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-114">Providing more than required information to a stakeholder may simply generate confusion.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-115"><b>Disclosing Based on Regulatory / Legislative Requirements</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-116">In certain industries, such as credit cards, you need
 to comply with specific regulations. Such regulations may require you 
to initiate communication with the right stakeholders when an incident 
occurs.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-117">When complying with regulation, communication with the stakeholders is a mandate that has to be followed.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-118"><b>Preventing Inadvertent Release of Information</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-119">During an incident, the inadvertent release of 
information must be protected. Any stakeholder that is not required to 
know the information about the incident, simply should not know. There 
will be stakeholders, such as users, who may need to know only a certain
 amount of information. Therefore, you need to release only the required
 information rather than providing complete information regarding the 
incident.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-120">Moreover, one of the critical aspects of releasing 
the correct information is that the designated personnel should release 
it. For example, if you need to release the information to the public 
regarding an incident, the most appropriate person would be from the 
Public Relations team.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-121"><b>Using a Secure Method of Communication</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-122">When communicating the incident with the 
stakeholders, you need to ensure that a secure method is used. It is 
always best to avoid the normal communication channel, such as Email.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-123">You should focus on using an out-of-band method for 
communicating the incident. An out-of-band method is a communication 
method that is normally not used. For example, if your normal method of 
communication is through an email, you may choose to communicate via 
mobile phone instead. However, you have to ensure that the method that 
you use for communication is using end-to-end encryption.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-124"><b>Reporting Requirements</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-125">Reporting is a critical task in the incident response
 process. When dealing with the incident, the IR team must report in an 
appropriate fashion to the required stakeholders, who can be the 
management team or even the legal authorities outside the companies.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-126">Based on the defined timeline, the reporting must be 
done accordingly. However, a daily brief must be shared with the 
management and the legal authorities to keep them updated on the 
progress.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-127">After the incident is handled and closed, a final 
report should be prepared. The report should include the complete 
incident detail. It should include:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-128">

<li id="cn-m21-128">the activities performed</li>

<li id="cn-m21-129">the outcome of the incident</li>

<li id="cn-m21-130">the root cause of the incident</li>

<li id="cn-m21-131">the damage caused by the incident and how it is contained and eradicated</li>

<li id="cn-m21-132">any specific deficiencies found during the incident - personnel, processes, or infrastructure.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m21-133">The report should be designed in a manner that can be
 understood by the Management Team. The report should also be targeted 
to the legal authorities if required.</p>

<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m21-135"><b>Exercise 2 - Response Coordination with Relevant Entities</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m21-136">When you create the incident response (IR) process, there are going to be various stakeholders who are going to be involved.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-137">These stakeholders are usually part of different 
departments, such as Human Resources, Marketing, and Legal. Each 
stakeholder plays a key role in the entire process, which also includes 
forming the Incident Response (IR) Team.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-138">In this exercise, you will learn about various stakeholders who will be involved in the IR process.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m21-140">After completing this exercise, you will have further knowledge of:</p>

<p id="cn-m21-149"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m21-c-6" src="ImportanceofIncidentResponse_files/image-m21-c-6.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-150"><b>Legal and Law Enforcement</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-151">If an incident occurs, there may be a need to involve
 the Legal Team to handle any kind of legal liabilities. This is 
required because you may have to report the incident to the Law 
Enforcement Team.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-152">In such a scenario, the Legal Team is the best 
candidate to deal with the Law Enforcement Team. The Legal Team should 
be involved in writing the correct wordings for communication with law 
enforcement or even the external stakeholders.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-153">The Law Enforcement Team or Personnel would be 
external to the organization. In some cases, the organization may be 
compliant with a regulation that requires it to inform law enforcement, 
which is likely to view the incident from a different angle than the 
Internal Security Team.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-154">Law enforcement may adopt a different method than the
 Internal Team. For example, when the incident has occurred, the 
Internal Security Team will be attempting to close the incident as soon 
as possible. However, the Law Enforcement Team may want the incident to 
continue to gain more insights.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-155"><b>Human Resources (HR)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-156">Often internal users are involved in an incident. To deal with these users, you should connect with the HR Team.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-157">If there is an internal user who is found to be 
intentionally involved with an incident, the HR Team will initiate the 
removal of the user in the right manner. They will enforce the policies 
for the removal of such users. Ideally, the HR Team should have a set of
 policies for hiring and firing employees.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-158">They are also the best candidate for creating the job
 descriptions for the contractors or consultants who may have to 
participate in the incident.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-159"><b>Public Relations</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-160">If you need to put the incident in front of the public, then you need a Public Relations Team.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-161">There will be scenarios in which you have to make the
 incident public, or it is leaked to the public, in either of the cases,
 the organization’s reputation is at stake.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-162">To handle this incident with the public, the Public 
Relations Team can put the correct message forward. The message needs to
 be appropriate for the public to help them understand the incident in 
the right manner.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-163"><b>Internal and External Stakeholders</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-164">There would be internal and external stakeholders. 
For example, the users of the organization can be considered as internal
 stakeholders. In case of an incident, they need to provide the right 
message.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-165">The external stakeholders could be third-party 
vendors, partners, consultants, and anyone who deals with the 
organization. They need to be communicated with the correct message 
about the incident.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-166"><b>Senior Leadership</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-167">Senior leadership plays an important role in the 
Incident Response Plan. This team has to not only provide approvals but 
also has to provide financial support to deal with the incidents.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-168">This team is also the key entity that communicates 
the Incident Response Plan with the rest of the organization. The senior
 leadership provides any kind of approval that is required in dealing 
with an incident.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-169"><b>Regulatory Bodies</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-170">The regulatory bodies are responsible for putting 
penalties on the organization if there is a deviation found in the 
compliance of a specific regulation. They usually deal with the Legal 
Team of the organization in an incident.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-174">Different types of data have different levels of criticality.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-175">There will be data that is general and can be used by
 anyone. On the other hand, there can be data that is personal to an 
individual and cannot be shared with anyone.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-176">The criticality of the data is dependent on its type.
 Some of the factors that define the data criticality are personally 
identifiable information (PII) or intellectual property (IP). Several 
other factors will be discussed in this exercise.</p>

<li id="cn-m21-200">Home address</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m21-202">Different countries and regulations may have 
different qualifiers to identify PII. Therefore, in the security field, 
you must know the regulations and laws of different countries to protect
 PII.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-203">PII must be protected from the threat agents. PII can
 be shared confidentially, but with whom and what data needs to be 
shared has to be carefully decided. Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is 
valuable if your organization deals with PII, which is considered to be 
critical and is considered highly sensitive. With the help of DLP, this 
information can be protected.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-204"><b>Personal Health Information (PHI)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-205">An organization may be dealing with Personal Health 
Information (PHI), which is the information about some of the key 
aspects of an individual:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-206">

<li id="cn-m21-206">Diagnoses</li>

<li id="cn-m21-207">Medications</li>

<li id="cn-m21-208">Demographics</li>

<li id="cn-m21-209">Family history</li>

<li id="cn-m21-210">Hospital visits</li>

<li id="cn-m21-211">Medical test results</li>

<li id="cn-m21-212">Mental health condition</li>

<li id="cn-m21-213">Medical insurance information</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m21-214">PHI contains information about the medical records of
 an individual. In the US, the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) regulation is designed to protect the
 PHI of an individual. In the UK, it is covered by the Data Protection 
Act. Any organization, such as healthcare facilities that deal with the 
PHI must be compliant with HIPAA or similar.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-215"><b>Special Protected Information (SPI)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-216">Sensitive Personal&nbsp;Information (SPI) is 
information about an individual that is considered private and 
confidential. SPI, however, cannot directly identify an individual. 
Because SPI is about an individual, if it is made public, it can cause 
much damage to the individual. For example, it could be personal 
information such as the biometric data of an individual.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-217">Other SPI can include information, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-218">

<li id="cn-m21-218">Racial or ethnic origin</li>

<li id="cn-m21-219">Political opinions</li>

<li id="cn-m21-220">Religious beliefs</li>

<li id="cn-m21-221">Philosophical beliefs</li>

<li id="cn-m21-222">Trade union membership</li>

<li id="cn-m21-223">Genetic data</li>

<li id="cn-m21-224">Biometric data</li>

<li id="cn-m21-225">Health data</li>

<li id="cn-m21-226">Sexual orientation</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m21-227"><b>High-Value Asset</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-228">A High-Value Asset (HVA) is an asset that can be either in the physical or logical form.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-229">In the physical form, it can be a system or device.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-230">In the logical form, it can be some information.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-231">An HVA is critical for the organization. If an HVA is
 lost or compromised, it can cause serious damage to the organization. 
For example, consider that there is a critical Web application that is 
running on a Webserver. This Web application is a source of major 
revenue for the organization. Now, you can consider this Web application
 as HVA. If this Web application crashes, then the organization would 
lose a major source of revenue, which may bring the organization’s 
functions to a halt.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-232">Some of the key examples of HVA are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-233">

<li id="cn-m21-233">Servers</li>

<li id="cn-m21-234">Network devices</li>

<li id="cn-m21-235">Web applications</li>

<li id="cn-m21-236">Confidential information</li>

<li id="cn-m21-237">Employee records</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m21-238">Depending on the role of the asset, if it is critical
 for the organization, it can be considered as HVA, which in most cases 
are the targets for the attackers. The key interest for the attacker is 
to compromise the asset and extract the information. Therefore, the 
organization has to ensure appropriate security measure is in place for 
the HVAs by implementing the following:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-239">

<li id="cn-m21-239">Identify the HVAs</li>

<li id="cn-m21-240">Prioritize the HVAs based on their criticality within the organization</li>

<li id="cn-m21-241">Implement HVA governance program</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m21-242"><b>Financial Information</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-243">Financial data for an organization is critical and 
confidential information. Its confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability must be protected at any cost. Consider an organization 
whose financial information is released publicly without their consent. 
The private financial information can cause serious damage to the 
organization’s reputation because each organization has a certain 
process to work with the finances.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-244">The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) of 1999 provides 
the guidelines to the organizations for protecting their financial 
information. GLBA, which is the United States Federal Law, applies to 
several types of organizations, such as</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-245">

<li id="cn-m21-245">Banks</li>

<li id="cn-m21-246">Finance and loan</li>

<li id="cn-m21-247">Insurance</li>

<li id="cn-m21-248">Investment</li>

<li id="cn-m21-249">Credit card providers</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m21-250">Any organization falling into these categories must 
be compliant with GLBA. They must secure their financial information and
 also must NOT share such information with any outsiders or 
third-parties.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-251"><b>Intellectual Property (IP)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-252">An IP is considered to be something, an asset, that 
is the creation of a mind. It can be a tangible or intangible asset. The
 creator of the asset has complete ownership. In the simplest term, 
anything that you create with your thought process becomes your IP. For 
example, if you compose a song on your own, it is your intellectual 
property.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-253">There are different types of intellectual property:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-254">

<li id="cn-m21-254">Music</li>

<li id="cn-m21-255">Paintings</li>

<li id="cn-m21-256">Literary works</li>

<li id="cn-m21-257">Symbols</li>

<li id="cn-m21-258">Images</li>

<li id="cn-m21-259">Logos</li>

<li id="cn-m21-260">Slogans</li>

<li id="cn-m21-261">Any type of product or a concept</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m21-262">The intellectual property must be protected from any 
kind of misuse. For example, the song that you composed is now copied by
 someone else. It is a theft of your intellectual property. To be able 
to protect your intellectual property, there are different laws:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-263">

<li id="cn-m21-263">Copyright</li>

<li id="cn-m21-264">Trademark</li>

<li id="cn-m21-265">Patent</li>

<li id="cn-m21-266">Trade secrets</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m21-267">Imagine a scenario in which an organization has its 
intellectual property information stolen in a security attack. The 
organization will not only face damage to its reputation but can also 
face legal implications. Therefore, the organization needs to protect 
its data.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-268">Depending on the type of intellectual property, you 
may have different types of laws that apply. For example, for literary 
works, copyright will be applicable. Trademark will be applicable for a 
logo or slogan.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-269"><b>Corporate Information</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-270">Corporate information is the type of information that
 is specific to an organization. It can consist of confidential and 
critical information such as processes, customer data, or even the login
 credentials.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-271">The data residing on the file servers, databases, and
 Web applications can also be considered as corporate data. The 
corporate information must be protected to ensure its confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-272">With the implementation of a large technology 
landscape, most organizations allow the users to either remotely connect
 or access corporate data using their own devices under the Bring Your 
Device (BYOD) policies. However, in most cases, the data is accessed 
using devices that are not protected.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-273">Imagine a scenario in which a user accesses the 
corporate Web application using a personal mobile phone, which is not 
encrypted. If the user loses the mobile phone, you can consider that the
 corporate data is at high risk. Such BYOD devices must be protected 
using Mobile Device Management (MDM) policies, which can even allow the 
administrator to erase data in case the mobile phone is stolen or lost.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-274">The network on which the corporate data resides must 
be protected as well. It should be protected with appropriate security 
controls, such as Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), firewall, and even 
Data Loss Prevention (DLP) to protect the data from an insider threat.</p>
