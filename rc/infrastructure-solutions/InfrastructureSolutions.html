<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m19-47"><b>Exercise 1 - On-premises and Cloud Infrastructure</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m19-48">A few years back, the only options for IT 
infrastructure hosting were either on-premises or in third-party data 
centers. In the last few years, the cloud environment was established, 
and several thousands of organizations moved their infrastructure to the
 cloud. However, several organizations decided to still stick with a 
more traditional on-premises infrastructure. There are good and bad 
sides of both types.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-49">In this exercise, you will learn about the on-premises and cloud infrastructure.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m19-51">After completing this exercise, you will have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-52">

<li id="cn-m19-52">On-premise and Cloud Infrastructure</li>

<p id="cn-m19-55">This exercise contains supporting materials for CySA+.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-56"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m19-c-1" src="InfrastructureSolutions_files/image-m19-c-1.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m19-57"><b>On-premise and Cloud Infrastructure</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-58">You can either deploy an infrastructure on-premises or
 in a cloud environment. The fundamental difference between the two is 
where and how it is done. When you refer to an on-premises 
infrastructure, the complete environment is in your control, such as 
security, network, physical systems, and applications. However, in a 
cloud environment, deployment is done at the vendorâ€™s end, but the type 
of control you have on the environment is dependent on the cloud 
deployment model, which can be one of the following:</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-59"><b><i>Software as a Service (SaaS)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-60">In the Software as a Service model, an application is 
licensed to users after they purchase a subscription. The license holder
 must then renew their subscription to continue to use the full features
 of the application. Typically, users will need a Web browser to access 
the application. For example, <b>GoToMeeting</b>, which is hosted online.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-61"><b><i>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-62">Infrastructure as a Service is an online model that 
provides virtualization of underlying network infrastructures such as 
physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, 
security, and backups. Virtual machines, software-defined networking, 
and virtual network devices are all considered parts of the IaaS model. 
IaaS provides flexibility in upscaling and downscaling infrastructure as
 required.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-63"><b><i>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-64">In Platform as a Service, a platform for development 
is offered to users on a subscription basis. In this model, a set of 
development tools are provided by the service provider. It reduces the 
cost of purchasing these tools outright.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-65"><b><i>Network as a Service (NaaS)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-66">With Network as a Service, clients have access to 
additional network resources, such as switches and routers. The 
third-party provider owns the resources and provides it to an 
organization either through a fixed fee or a fee based on component 
usage.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-67"><b><i>Security as a Service (SECaaS)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-68">Security as a Service offers cloud-based security 
solutions. When you implement this solution, it removes the burden of 
having the on-premises hardware.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m19-69"><b>Advantages and Disadvantages</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-70">There are several advantages and disadvantages of both the environments:</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-71"><b><i>Control</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-72">The biggest advantage of an on-premises infrastructure
 is that you have complete control over the physical as well as the 
logical environment. You can customize the said environment as per your 
business requirements. You can also add or remove hardware and software 
as and when required. However, with the cloud, you have little control 
over the infrastructure. For example, the physical environment is not in
 your control.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-73"><b><i>Cost</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-74">In the on-premises infrastructure model, the cost of 
deployment is very high. You have to purchase the physical hardware, 
which can include desktops, servers, switches, firewalls, routers, and 
various other networking and security devices. You also have to purchase
 licenses for software that the users are going to use. You also have to
 maintain your infrastructure or outsource maintenance to a third-party.
 When referring to the cloud environment, they mostly work with the 
pay-per-use or subscription model. This means that you do not have to 
pay the upfront cost of deploying hardware or software. You can start 
using the environment, and depending on the payment model, and you have 
to pay accordingly. Another big advantage is that you can customize your
 infrastructure on the fly.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-75"><b><i>Redundancy</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-76">With an on-premises infrastructure, you have to 
protect against redundancy of the entire environment by adding another 
site. This can add a huge cost to the organization. However, in the 
cloud environment, the infrastructure is already replicated or can be 
replicated to another geography. This adds redundancy to the 
infrastructure and data.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-77"><b><i>Security</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-78">With on-premises infrastructures, security can be set 
at a certain level as per the requirement of the organization. Depending
 on the regulations or any type of compliance requirements, such as <b>ISO 27001 </b>or <b>PCI-DSS</b>,
 organizations can add or remove the security controls. However, in the 
cloud environment, data security is always a question. Several 
organizations in the Banking and Finance sectors tend to use the 
on-premises infrastructure that is required to provide the optimum level
 of security.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-79"><b><i>Compliance</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-80">The organizations may have to comply with certain regulations, such as <b>HIPAA </b>or <b>PCI-DSS</b>.
 Therefore, organizations can customize their IT environment with 
specific security controls. On the other hand, the cloud service 
provider may be compliant with these regulations, but it is your 
responsibility to perform a due diligence. Ultimately, you are 
responsible for your data.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m19-81"><b>Cloud Access Service Broker (CASB)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-82">In the simplest terms, a CASB is a mediator between a 
cloud consumer and service provider. The key role of a CASB is to bridge
 security gaps from the cloud consumer to the cloud service provider, 
who may be running SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS. A CASB can also extend the 
organizational security policies into the cloud environment and enforce 
them on cloud components and services as they are accessed. Users may be
 using various types of devices, such as laptops or mobile. The same set
 of security policies, which are applied in the on-premises 
infrastructure, can be extended to the cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-83">It seems that generally, organizations are quite 
apprehensive about putting their data in the cloud. However, with the 
CASB implementation, there are enough security controls and methods that
 can be applied to protect data. With a CASB, you can use a security 
control, such as a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or secure Web 
gateways. Other security offerings that a CASB may offer:</p>

<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m19-95"><b>Exercise 2 - Network Architecture</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m19-96">A network architecture consists of multiple 
components. Physical components play a key role in the architecture. You
 may also have a virtual environment, but even for it to run, you still 
need to have the physical components available. You can have different 
types of networks and components within a single IT environment. You may
 have software-defined networking (SDN), a virtual private network 
(VPN), or you may be using cloud-based technologies like VPC or 
serverless.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-97">In this exercise, you will learn about various types of components of a network.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m19-99">After completing this exercise, you will have a further knowledge of:</p>

<p id="cn-m19-106">This exercise contains supporting materials for CySA+.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-107"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m19-c-2" src="InfrastructureSolutions_files/image-m19-c-2.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m19-108"><b>Physical</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-109">Each organization will either have a small or large 
physical IT infrastructure. For example, if an organization has an 
entire IT infrastructure in the cloud environment,  users will still 
have laptops and mobile devices that they use to connect to remote 
resources in the cloud. Laptops and mobile devices make up the physical 
environment. On the other hand, you may have an organization that has a 
large infrastructure that they run from their data center, which 
consists of routers, switches, servers, firewalls, and many other 
components.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-110">It could also be possible that an organization uses a
 hybrid model, which has some servers in the on-premises datacenter and 
the rest of the servers in the cloud. When there is physical 
infrastructure, the organization is responsible for physical and logical
 security.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m19-111"><b>Software-defined Networking (SDN)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-112">Software-defined networking (SDN) helps 
administrators to initialize, control, change, and manage network 
behavior dynamically. SDN is there to address static architecture of 
traditional networks, as they do not support dynamic or scaleable 
computing and storage needs of more modern computing environments such 
as data centers. This is done by decoupling or disassociating the system
 that makes decisions about where traffic is sent (the SDN controller, 
or control plane) from the underlying systems that forward traffic to 
the selected destination (the data plane).</p>

<h3 id="cn-m19-113"><b>Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-114">A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated
 part of the cloud environment. Almost all cloud service providers allow
 you to use VPCs using your account. You can create a VPC and add 
various resources within it. There are several components that you can 
use within the VPC. Some of the key components are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-115">

<li id="cn-m19-115">IP address ranges</li>

<li id="cn-m19-116">Subnets</li>

<li id="cn-m19-117">Route tables</li>

<li id="cn-m19-118">Network gateways</li>

<li id="cn-m19-119">VPC endpoint</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m19-120"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m19-c-3" src="InfrastructureSolutions_files/image-m19-c-3.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 Diagram showing the VPC"><figcaption>Figure 2.1 Diagram showing the VPC: Showing VPC architecture on AWS.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m19-121">You can think of a VPC as a small, isolated cloud 
within a larger cloud. You are free to configure the type of VPC that 
meets your requirements. A VPC for a customer is isolated from the rest 
of the VPCs that are running within the same cloud. You can provision a 
VPC within the cloud environment, create a virtual network, and then 
launch various resources within the network.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-122">In some of the cases, a cloud service provider may give you the following choices to configure a VPC:</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-123">

<li id="cn-m19-123">A VPC with a single public subnet</li>

<li id="cn-m19-124">A VPC with public and private subnets</li>

<li id="cn-m19-125">A VPC with public and private subnets and hardware VPN access</li>

<li id="cn-m19-126">A VPC with private subnet and hardware VPN access</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m19-127">You are free to choose the type of VPC you want to 
configure. If you are looking to configure an isolated private subnet, 
you can configure it and then connect it to the on-premises data center 
using hardware VPN access, which will use IPSec encrypted tunnel for 
traffic routing.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-128">For example, this is the example of Amazon AWS, where you are configuring a VPC with public and private subnets.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-130"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m19-c-4" src="InfrastructureSolutions_files/image-m19-c-4.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2 Diagram showing the VPC configuration"><figcaption>Figure 2.2 Diagram showing the VPC configuration: Showing VPC configuration with a public and private subnet.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<h3 id="cn-m19-132"><b>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-133">VPNs allow users remote access and allows them 
specific access to resources on the internal network. Using the public 
network, which is the Internet, the user can connect to the VPN server 
using his or her login credentials. Based on the access granted to the 
user, he or she will be able to access resources on the network. To 
connect to and access the network, you need to use a client installed on
 the userâ€™s end to connect to the VPN server.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-134">There are primarily two types of VPNs:</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-135"><b><i>Site-to-Site VPN</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-136">where a VPN is established between Customer Premises 
Equipment (CPE) devices found at the location of each site. 
Specifically, these are the routers found at each location.  A VPN is 
established between them such that the clients at each site are 
oblivious to any VPN configurations. They communicate with each other as
 if, from their point of view, they are on the same private network. The
 VPN routers on each end provide the VPN functionality between the two 
sites.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-137"><b><i>Client-to-Site VPN</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-138">where a VPN is established between a single user, and
 a VPN enabled server or router. The server is located on the corporate 
network and accepts and establishes VPN requests from clients. Clients 
must have the appropriate VPN software and the appropriate credentials 
to establish the VPN. A VPN server can allow multiple client connections
 simultaneously.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m19-139"><b>Serverless</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-140">Serverless architecture, also known as Function As A Service (<b>FaaS</b>),
 is based out of the cloud. A developer does not have to set up the 
infrastructure, which is completely managed and handled by the cloud 
service provider. The developer has to focus on developing an 
application rather than spending time in setting up the infrastructure. 
With the serverless technology, the applications are built directly in 
the cloud environment, and applications run on the servers as they do in
 the on-premises infrastructure. As and when required, there is 
automatic provisioning and scaling of the underlying infrastructure.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-141">There is often confusion between <b>PaaS </b>and <b>FaaS</b>.
 Both follow the same concept of running an application in the cloud. 
However, the underlying architectural differences are there. In <b>PaaS</b>,
 the entire application is run as a single unit, which means that the 
scaling can only be done at the application level, However, in <b>FaaS</b>,
 the scaling is done at the function level because the application is 
composed at the function level. As and when required, the functions can 
be scaled individually. This saves many system resources because you may
 have only one function that consumes more resources than the others.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-142">Serverless architecture is good to use when you have a
 limited number of functions. If you have an existing application, you 
will need to architect it again to run as small functions that can run 
independently.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-147">Assets are critical for an organization. Each 
organization will have several types of assets, such as hardware and 
software. Asset Management is a process that helps an organization 
maintain and manage its assets. The information for all IT assets can be
 maintained in a centralized database, which is known as the 
Configuration Management Database (CMDB). It helps you collate asset 
information, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-148">

<li id="cn-m19-148">Type</li>

<li id="cn-m19-149">Make</li>

<li id="cn-m19-150">Owner</li>

<li id="cn-m19-151">Service record</li>

<li id="cn-m19-152">Maintenance record</li>

<li id="cn-m19-153">Allocation record</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m19-154">Based on the information maintained in the CMDB, it 
is easy for an organization to view the complete set of assets that are 
functional or non-functional.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-155">In this exercise, you will learn about assets and asset tagging.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m19-162"><b>Asset Tagging</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-163">Before understanding types of assets, it is important
 to understand what an asset is. It is anything that has value to an 
organization. It could be servers, software, devices, the information in
 any format, services, people, or even intangibles, such as reputation 
or brand.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-164">Assets typically have owners and custodians.</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-165">

<li id="cn-m19-165"><b>Owner</b>: performs asset management and is responsible for handling, disclosure, and retirement of assets.</li>

<li id="cn-m19-166"><b>Custodian</b>: is responsible for protecting data
 as per security requirements. The custodian provides accessibility of 
assets to end-users. They are also responsible for quality assurance and
 data validation.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m19-167">Types of assets in an organization are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-168">

<li id="cn-m19-168"><b>People</b>: Includes employees and customers.</li>

<li id="cn-m19-169"><b>Hardware</b>: Includes servers, desktops, laptops, and any devices that are being owned by the organization.</li>

<li id="cn-m19-170"><b>Software</b>: Includes operating systems and applications that are used for business purposes.</li>

<li id="cn-m19-171"><b>Data</b>: Includes business and employee information.</li>

<li id="cn-m19-172"><b>Physical environment</b>: Includes the physical infrastructure, which includes the business premises.</li>

<li id="cn-m19-173"><b>Processes</b>: Includes the processes and procedures that enable an organization to run its business.</li>

<li id="cn-m19-174"><b>Third-parties</b>: Includes partners, and associated hardware/software.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m19-175"><b><i>Asset Inventories</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-176">Asset inventories are critical when figuring out what
 to protect and how much to spend protecting it. Asset inventories 
should be checked periodically to verify accuracy. Inventories should 
track details necessary for the following reasons:</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-177">

<li id="cn-m19-177">Asset identification</li>

<li id="cn-m19-178">Date of acquisition</li>

<li id="cn-m19-179">Security Classification</li>

<li id="cn-m19-180">Descriptive details</li>

<li id="cn-m19-181">Asset Location</li>

<li id="cn-m19-182">Information necessary for backup and restore, disaster recovery</li>

<li id="cn-m19-183">Asset owner and custodial information</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m19-184"><b><i>Asset tags</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-185">Asset tags are used to track hardware. An asset tag 
has a barcode or a serial number. When you scan the barcode, the 
complete hardware details of the item are fetched from the inventory 
database. Consider the example of a grocery store. When you purchase an 
item, the cash counter person simply scans the barcode on the item, and 
it is added for checkout.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-186">You can replicate the grocery storeâ€™s scenario in 
your organization where you can use an asset tag, which will then be 
placed on each hardware item, such as a laptop, desktop, printers, 
servers, and so on. By scanning the tag, you can maintain assets in an 
inventory management system. You can put a number series on the tags, 
which, when entered into the inventory management system, will pull out 
all information from the date it was acquired to it was disposed of. An 
asset tag can be an RFID-based, which can help you track them. The 
number of assets and paper labels may help you mark an asset, but they 
cannot track them.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-187">You can use an asset tag with a bar code, which does 
not require any manual intervention when entering or pulling out 
information about a tag. For example, instead of typing the asset 
number, you can scan the barcode to retrieve complete information about 
an asset. The number of assets and paper labels may help you mark the 
asset, but they are manual methods and are prone to human error.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-190">No network can ever be static. There will always be 
changes due to various reasons, such as improving security or even 
adding new functionality. For example, you may be upgrading an 
application with a new version. However, the smallest change in the 
network environment can cause chaos and, therefore, needs to be handled 
with caution and using proper processes and procedures.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-191">In this exercise, you will learn about change management.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m19-193">After completing this exercise, you will have a further knowledge of:</p>

<h3 id="cn-m19-198"><b>Change Management</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-199">In a network environment, you may want to implement a
 new application or add a new server. Before doing any such activity, 
you need to be aware that there is a change that is going to take place 
on the network. The change can work without causing any disruption, or 
it can simply cause chaos, which you would want to avoid.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-200">For example, you want to add a new security 
application on the network. In a typical scenario, you would go ahead 
and install and configure the application without giving much thought of
 the consequences that you may have to go through later on. If it works 
fine without any disruption to the network or other services, it is 
fine. What if it does not? You want to protect the disruption or any 
unwanted results from this application. Therefore, the safest route is 
to go through the change management process.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-201">The change management process helps you make a change
 in an environment in a systematic manner. The change that you are going
 to make is thought through and then approved by a set of designated 
personnel. The change that you want to implement needs to be tested, 
approved, deployed and documented.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-202">There are a certain steps that you need to perform 
during the process. However, different organizations may have slight 
variations. Some organizations may simply follow the 6-steps process, 
and some may have more steps. There is no hard rule on the number of 
steps as long as you have implemented the basic set of steps to fulfil 
the change management criteria.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-203">The broad level steps are:</p>

<p id="cn-m19-204"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m19-c-7" src="InfrastructureSolutions_files/image-m19-c-7.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1 Diagram showing the Change Management Phases"><figcaption>Figure 4.1 Diagram showing the Change Management Phases: Showing the six different phases the Change Management process.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<ol id="cn-m19-205">

<li id="cn-m19-205"><b>Create Request for Change</b>: First, you need to
 create a Request for Change (RFC), which requires information such as 
description, configuration items, reason, and information about the 
person requesting the change. It will also require information, such as 
cost, timeframe, justification, and fallback plan.</li>

<li id="cn-m19-206"><b>Review Request for Change (RFC</b>): A team of 
designated personnel reviews the RFC. If the information with the RFC is
 found to be appropriate, it is then approved. If not, the RFC is 
rejected and returned to the person who submitted it.</li>

<li id="cn-m19-207"><b>Evaluate the Change</b>: The change that has to 
be implemented, its impact needs to be assessed. The change needs to be 
thoroughly evaluated and then documented in the Change Evaluation 
Report.</li>

<li id="cn-m19-208"><b>Authorize the Change</b>: After a thorough evaluation of the change is completed, the change needs to be authorized for implementation.</li>

<li id="cn-m19-209"><b>Implement the Change</b>: After a change is 
authorized, it can be implemented. Before the implementation, a backup 
plan is also prepared in case the change fails, or the results are 
unexpected. The implementation team should be able to fall back to the 
original configuration.</li>

<li id="cn-m19-210"><b>Close the Request</b>: After the change is implemented, a Post Implementation Review (PIR) is prepared. It contains the details of the change.</li>

<p id="cn-m19-214">Scalability is always a challenge when it comes to 
networks, systems, and applications. When you need to scale up, you have
 to add the physical hardware. However, to a great extent, this problem 
is solved by virtualization and containerization. Both can help you 
increase agility in the IT operations and can help you scale up and 
scale down the infrastructure as required.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-215">Virtualization and containerization are similar but 
work with different approaches. The only fundamental similarity in both 
of these concepts is that they create and work with self-contained 
packages. However, beyond this, they differ in their functionalities and
 use cases.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-216">In this exercise, you will learn about virtualization and containerization.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m19-218">After completing this exercise, you will have a further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-219">

<h3 id="cn-m19-224"><b>Virtualization and Containerization</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-225">Virtualization allows a systemâ€™s physical hardware to
 be emulated in the form of virtual systems. Each physical system has a 
certain amount of physical resources, such as CPU, memory, network 
adapter, and storage. When you install an operating system, it can use 
system resources. However, there is only one operating system that can 
run per physical system.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-226">With the use of virtualization, you can run multiple 
virtual systems. Virtualization allows a single processor to act as 
multiple processors. When you run multiple virtual machines on the 
system, virtualization helps the processor to isolate tasks.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-227">You need to have a hypervisor, which is responsible 
for virtualization in a system. A hypervisor allows multiple operating 
systems to run in parallel and consume the system resources. These 
operating systems run within a shell, which is known as a virtual 
machine. Each virtual machine works like a normal system, except that it
 does not have any physical hardware. The physical system that runs the 
virtual machine must have a hypervisor to run a virtual machine.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-228">Hypervisor makes the creation of virtual machines 
possible on a physical computer. The virtual machine is a guest computer
 within a hypervisor with its operating system and synthetic hardware. 
You can also edit the virtual machine settings and customize them to 
suit your needs.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-229"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m19-c-9" src="InfrastructureSolutions_files/image-m19-c-9.jpg" alt="Figure 5.1 Diagram showing the virtual machine properties"><figcaption>Figure
 5.1 Diagram showing the virtual machine properties: Showing the virtual
 machine configuration properties in Type 2 hypervisor.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m19-231">There are two types of hypervisors:</p>

<p id="cn-m19-232"><b>Type 1: </b>The Type 1 hypervisor is not dependent
 on an operating system. Type 1 hypervisors run on a bare-metal system 
and does not require an operating system in between to host the virtual 
machines. In the Type 1 hypervisor, the order of layers is as follows:</p>

<ol id="cn-m19-233">

<li id="cn-m19-233">Hypervisor</li>

<li id="cn-m19-234">Operating System</li>

<li id="cn-m19-235">Hardware</li>

</ol>

<p id="cn-m19-236"><b>Type 2: </b>In the Type 2 hypervisor, the order of layers is as follows:</p>

<ol id="cn-m19-237">

<li id="cn-m19-237">Guest OS</li>

<li id="cn-m19-238">Hypervisor</li>

<li id="cn-m19-239">Operating System</li>

<li id="cn-m19-240">Hardware</li>

</ol>

<p id="cn-m19-241">The operating system, which is layer 3, is installed 
on the base hardware. On the operating system, you need to install a 
TYPE 2 hypervisor, such as VMware Workstation. Then, on the top, you 
will have the guest virtual machines.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-242"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m19-c-10" src="InfrastructureSolutions_files/image-m19-c-10.jpg" alt="Figure 5.2 Diagram showing the VMware Workstation Player"><figcaption>Figure 5.2 Diagram showing the VMware Workstation Player: Showing the virtual machine in the Type 2 hypervisor.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-243"><b><i>Containerization</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-244">Containers work on the concept of compartments. They 
use the operating system from the host to deploy applications. You can 
deploy multiple containers on a single host, and each container can run 
different applications. However, the operating system will remain the 
same on all containers on a single physical host. Therefore, if you need
 to run a container with a different operating system, you need to 
deploy them on another physical host.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-245">One of the great advantages of a container is that it
 runs using the operating system and base system resources; it is 
lightweight and can start as soon as a system boots. However, this can 
also lead to a disadvantage because if there is a vulnerability in the 
OS kernel, then all containers running on the operating system will have
 the same vulnerability.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-246">Containers are useful when you need to run multiple 
applications using the same operating system. You can quickly create a 
container and run the application within it.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-247">There are typically four layers for a container:</p>

<ol id="cn-m19-248">

<li id="cn-m19-248">Operating system</li>

<li id="cn-m19-249">Container engine</li>

<li id="cn-m19-250">Binaries and libraries</li>

<li id="cn-m19-251">Application</li>

</ol>

<p id="cn-m19-252">Containers should be used when you need to have the 
native performance for an application. Since you are running part of the
 operating system within a container, there is generally less overhead, 
and you get good performance for hosting the application.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-253">There are several fundamental differences between virtualization and containerization. Some of the key differences are:</p>

<p id="cn-m19-254"><b>Speed</b>: Containers start with the operating 
system as it is loaded. Therefore, the start is immediate. However, 
virtual machines need to load the complete operating system.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-255"><b>Resources</b>: Containers start immediately with 
the operating system, and therefore, there is little memory consumption.
 On the other hand, there can be multiple virtual machines running on a 
single physical host, and each virtual machine will require its share of
 system resources. This can put the load on the physical server, which 
will impact the virtual machines ultimately.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-256"><b>Security and isolation</b>: Containers run within 
the operating system. Virtual machines run separately and in isolation. 
Therefore, the virtual machines tend to be more secure than containers. 
On the other hand, the containers can isolate the applications and their
 data only at the process level, and they are less secure. If the 
operating system is compromised, then the containers can also be 
compromised.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-257"><b>Portability</b>: Containers are much smaller in 
size, and therefore, they are easy to port. Virtual machines tend to be 
larger, and therefore, portability can be a problem. When you port a 
virtual machine, you need to include configuration files and libraries 
along with the virtual machine.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-258"><b>Operating System</b>: A virtual machine can run an
 independent operating system on a physical host. Containers can run 
only the operating system that the host is running.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m19-259"><b>Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-260">Virtual Desktop Infrastructure or <b>VDI </b>was coined by <b>VMware</b>, which later became the industry standard terminology. <b>VDI </b>allows
 a user to use an endpoint device, such as a thin client or a mobile 
device, and connect to a virtual desktop image. The VDI works like a 
conventional system except that it is in a virtual form and is hosted 
either in a data center or in the cloud. A <b>VDI </b>can work on a one-to-one or one-to-many ratio. In a one-to-one ratio, a <b>VDI </b>is assigned to a single user. In a one-to-many ratio, a VDI is assigned to multiple users.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-261">Different vendors have different methods to access a <b>VDI </b>using an endpoint. For example, there are three key players in the <b>VDI </b>market:</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-262">

<li id="cn-m19-262"><b>Citrix</b>: Uses Independent Computing Architecture (<b>ICA</b>) and Enlightened Data Transport (<b>EDT</b>)</li>

<li id="cn-m19-263"><b>VMware</b>: Uses Blast Extreme and PC over IP (PCoIP)</li>

<li id="cn-m19-264"><b>Microsoft</b>: Uses Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m19-265"><b>VDIs </b>are hosted on a centralized server and 
run in the form of virtual machines. A hypervisor hosts the virtual 
machines, which are then deployed as <b>VDIs</b>. Whenever a request is generated from a user, the connection broker works as the central authority to handle that request.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-266"><b>VDIs </b>can be of two types:</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-267">

<li id="cn-m19-267"><b>Persistent</b>: Works more like a personalized desktop. A user is assigned a <b>VDI</b>, which can be customized by the user. When the user closes the <b>VDI</b>, the changes are saved.</li>

<li id="cn-m19-268"><b>Non-persistent</b>: Works more like a temporary desktop. A user connects to a <b>VDI</b>, where the user works, but when the user logs off from the <b>VDI</b>, the changes are discarded.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m19-269">There are several benefits of using a <b>VDI</b>. Some of the key benefits are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-270">

<li id="cn-m19-270"><b>Remote connectivity</b>: Users can use their thin client or a mobile device to connect with the remote <b>VDI</b>.
 All files and data are stored on the servers. This provides the 
flexibility of using different devices for connectivity with VDI.</li>

<li id="cn-m19-271"><b>Cost</b>: Using <b>VDI </b>provides huge cost 
savings. You do not need to install, configure, and maintain high-end 
desktops and laptops. The users can work with the systems or any device 
with minimal configuration.</li>

<li id="cn-m19-272"><b>Security</b>: The data is stored on the centralized server, and therefore, it is more secure.</li>

<li id="cn-m19-273"><b>Management</b>: Since the <b>VDIs </b>are running on centralized servers, they are easy to manage. You can update or patch them in a centralized location.</li>
