<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m22-46"><b>Exercise 1 - Preparation</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m22-47">Incident Response is a process in which an 
organization manages to handle an attack, which could be of any nature, 
such as an attack on a Web application or a data breach. The 
organization must be able to manage the incident to limit the damage. 
When an organization is well prepared to handle the incident, it can 
save time, effort, and cost for the incident.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-48">To be able to handle the incident, the organization 
must have an Incident Response Plan, which defines the process to follow
 when an incident occurs. There are broadly five different phases that 
you have to follow through, Preparation, Detection and Analysis, 
Containment, Eradication and Recovery, and Post-incident Activities:</p>

<p id="cn-m22-49"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m22-c-1" src="InitialPhasesofIncidentResponse_files/image-m22-c-1.jpg" alt="Figure 1.1 Diagram of Incident Response Plan"><figcaption>Figure 1.1 Diagram of Incident Response Plan: Showing the phases of the Incident Response Plan.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m22-50">While searching on the Internet, you will find several
 variations in these phases. Every organization tailors the phases 
according to their own need.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-51">In this exercise, you will learn about the Preparation phase of Incident Response.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m22-53">After completing this module, you will have further knowledge of:</p>

<li id="cn-m22-56">Documentation of Procedures</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m22-58">This exercise contains supporting materials for CySA+.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-59"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m22-c-2" src="InitialPhasesofIncidentResponse_files/image-m22-c-2.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-60"><b>Training</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-61">After you have created the Incident Response Plan, you
 need to train the Incident Response (IR) team members. Each member of 
the team should be familiar with the plan. Each team member should be 
aware of his or her responsibilities that they need to perform if an 
incident occurs. It is important to note that there will be members of 
the other departments, not just the IT team. Therefore, the training on 
the Incident Response Plan should be in simple language rather than 
technical.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-62">In training, you need to ensure that you cover the following items during the training:</p>

<ul id="cn-m22-63">

<li id="cn-m22-63">Key terms related to Incident Response</li>

<li id="cn-m22-64">Key tasks performed in each phase</li>

<li id="cn-m22-65">Response methods based on the incident type</li>

<li id="cn-m22-66">Plan phases</li>

<li id="cn-m22-67">Roles and responsibilities</li>

<li id="cn-m22-68">Communication matrix</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m22-69">These are some of the key items that should be covered
 in training. Different organizations may add one or more items in 
training, but it is dependent on their training style and the coverage 
they want to do in training.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-70"><b>Testing</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-71">After you have created the plan and trained the team, 
you need to test the Incident Response Plan to ensure that it will work 
as expected. As part of the testing, you should develop mock incident 
scenarios and conduct testing around them. This will benefit the team 
members to understand the Incident Response Plan. This reduces the 
mistakes that they are going to make while handling an incident. Also, 
testing assures that the Incident Response Plan that you have created 
will be useful as and when an incident takes place.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-72"><b>Documentation of Procedures</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-73">As part of the Incident Response Plan, you need to 
define several processes and procedures, which must be well documented. 
You should document the following:</p>

<ul id="cn-m22-74">

<li id="cn-m22-74">Policies</li>

<li id="cn-m22-75">Procedures</li>

<li id="cn-m22-76">Governance methods</li>

<li id="cn-m22-77">Communication plans</li>

<li id="cn-m22-78">Agreements</li>

<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m22-80"><b>Exercise 2 - Detection and Analysis</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m22-81">Detection and Analysis is the second phase. There are 
several activities that you will perform in this phase. You have to use 
various tools and techniques to identify an incident. If you suspect an 
incident is taking place because you have observed an unusual pattern in
 the traffic or performance degradation in traffic on the Webserver, you
 can use various tools, such as Wireshark, to capture the traffic for 
analysis purposes.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-82">In this exercise, you will learn about the Detection and Analysis phase.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-95"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m22-c-3" src="InitialPhasesofIncidentResponse_files/image-m22-c-3.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-96"><b>Characteristics Contributing to Severity Level Classification</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-97">Different organizations have different severity level 
classifications. For example, one organization may have five levels of 
severity classifications, starting with Severity 1 to Severity 5. On the
 other hand, some organizations may have three levels, Severity 1 to 
Severity 3. In a nutshell, a severity level defines the amount of impact
 it has on the business functions. If the incident brings down the 
entire business function and puts it on a halt, it is considered as 
Severity 1 incident.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-98">In most cases, organizations tend to follow three levels, which are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m22-99">

<li id="cn-m22-99"><b>Severity 1: </b>It is an incident that has a high impact. For example, a Web server has been hacked, or a customer-facing application is down.</li>

<li id="cn-m22-100"><b>Severity 2: </b>It is an incident that has a 
lower impact than Severity 1, but it is still a significant impact. For 
example, a part of the Web application is not working, or the customers 
are not able to search for data within the application.</li>

<li id="cn-m22-101"><b>Severity 3: </b>It is an incident that has a low 
impact on business functions. For example, there is a performance issue 
with a Web application or read and write operations take a longer time 
than usual with a database.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m22-102">Several factors help an organization to define the 
severity levels. The biggest factor is the understanding of the 
business. If your business is of regular of the mill business, you will 
define your severity levels according to it. For example, if a server 
goes down at 4 AM, you know that it is not going to cause chaos with the
 customers, and therefore, you can fix it after 9 AM once the office 
opens. However, on the other hand, if it is a customer-facing Web 
application, you will tend to fix the issue right at 4 AM itself as it 
is marked as a Severity 1 incident, and you need to assign a high 
priority to this incident.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-103">Other factors can involve your team size, type of business, and dependencies on the internal or external IT teams.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-104"><b>Downtime</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-105">The downtime that occurs due to an incident is 
directly dependent on the severity of the incident. A Severity 1 
incident doesn't always need to take a longer time to resolve. For 
example, a firewall fails to function, which can be considered as an 
incident. However, a redundant firewall activates and takes over the 
primary firewall. Even though the incident is not fully resolved, there 
is a workaround that has reduced the downtime.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-106"><b>Recovery Time</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-107">The recovery time from an incident depends on how 
well the Incident Recovery team is prepared. If the team is well 
prepared, then they will be able to respond better and quickly when an 
incident occurs. This reduces recovery time. It also helps you minimize 
the losses that may occur due to an incident. The recovery plan should 
also focus on the recovery time of the incident. You should define the 
strategies and methods that you can use when an incident occurs.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-108">For recovering a system or an asset, you should understand the following key terms:</p>

<ul id="cn-m22-109">

<li id="cn-m22-109"><b>MTD </b>is the <b>Maximum Tolerable Downtime </b>for an asset on the network. The tolerable time may differ depending on the criticality defined for the asset.</li>

<li id="cn-m22-110">The <b>RTO </b>or <b>Recovery Time Objective </b>must
 be smaller than MTD, which is Maximum Tolerable Downtime. RTO defines 
the period within which the failed resource must be restored. Going 
beyond the defined RTO might have unacceptable consequences.</li>

<li id="cn-m22-111"><b>RPO</b>, <b>Recovery Point Objective</b>, defines the tolerance level for an organization to which they can revert to an older version of data from a backup.</li>

<li id="cn-m22-112"><b>Mean Time to Repair </b>or <b>MTTR </b>is the time required to repair a nonfunctional system or application.</li>

<li id="cn-m22-113"><b>WRT</b>, <b>Work Recovery Time</b>, is the gap between the RTO and MTD. It is the time after RTO is over, and that is left to reach MTD.</li>

<li id="cn-m22-114"><b>Mean Time Between Failures</b>, <b>MTBF</b>, is the time that a device or service operates before it fails.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m22-115"><b>Data Integrity</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-116">The data integrity is the data that retains its 
original and accurate form and has not been altered by unauthorized 
users. Data integrity is about retaining the original form of the data 
and its accuracy in its original form. The data will always be at risk 
in one way or the other. For example, whether it is a small or large 
breach that occurs on the network, it is the data and its integrity at 
stake. The organizations must implement methods, such as event 
detection, vulnerability management, and integrity monitoring, to 
protect the data and its integrity.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-117">When an incident occurs, the organizations need to 
ensure that the data integrity is not tampered with. The Incident 
Response (IR) team should restore the data during the recovery phase. 
After the restoration of the data, its integrity must be verified.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-118"><b>Economic</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-119">Each incident within an organization has a financial 
impact, which depends on the severity of the incident. The size of the 
financial impact is the loss that the organization incurs due to the 
incident. Smaller the incident, less is the financial or economic impact
 on the organization.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-120"><b>System Process Criticality</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-121">There are systems, servers, and various other assets 
in an organization. The assets that hold the critical data are typically
 known as the critical systems, and they must be well protected. The 
business processes will be hosting the data on the critical systems. You
 need to define their criticality so that in case of a large incident 
that impacts the entire or part of a network, you should know the 
systems that need to be recovered first.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-122"><b>Reverse Engineering</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-123">In many cases, malware is the source of an incident. 
The nature of the incident is dependent on the capabilities of the 
malware, which cannot be determined unless you reverse engineer it. When
 you reverse engineer the malware, you will be able to see the 
functionality of the code. With the help of the malware analysis method,
 you can understand the core functionalities and capabilities of the 
malware. Therefore, malware analysis should also be part of the Incident
 Response Plan. Within the team, there should be capabilities to know 
the reverse engineering methods and processes to handle malware in an 
incident.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-124"><b>Data Correlation</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-125">To improve the incident analysis, you will often need
 to perform data correlation. Logs are the most important sources for 
data correlation. You can track events through the logs. You should have
 a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system on the 
network, which gathers logs for analysis purposes from various servers 
and devices. You should correlate the data in SIEM and analyze to 
conclude that there is an incident that is either going on or has taken 
place.</p>

<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m22-128"><b>Exercise 3 - Containment</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m22-129">In the Incident Response process, containment is a 
critical activity. Depending on the nature of the incident, you will 
have to select the appropriate containment strategy, which helps you 
deal with the incident. The strategy that you select should be able to 
limit the damage that is caused by the incident. As soon as an incident 
is discovered, the compromised systems should either be isolated or 
segmented, depending on the nature of the incident.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-130">In this exercise, you will learn about the containment of an incident.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m22-132">After completing this module, you will have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m22-133">

<li id="cn-m22-133">Segmentation</li>

<li id="cn-m22-134">Isolation</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m22-138"><b>Segmentation</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-139">Segmentation can be done as a proactive or reactive 
approach. In the proactive approach, the network is divided into 
different segments. Each segment communicates to the other segments 
through a firewall. For example, you have three key segments on the 
network:</p>

<ul id="cn-m22-140">

<li id="cn-m22-140">Datacenter</li>

<li id="cn-m22-141">Users</li>

<li id="cn-m22-142">Guest</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m22-143"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m22-c-5" src="InitialPhasesofIncidentResponse_files/image-m22-c-5.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1 Diagram of Network Segmentation"><figcaption>Figure 3.1 Diagram of Network Segmentation: Showing the network segmentation.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m22-145">The segments can communicate with each other only 
through the firewall, which contains strict rules. In this scenario, if 
one of the segments is compromised, then the attacker will not be able 
to get into the other segments without traversing through the firewall.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-146">In the reactive mode, you build one or more segments 
for containment. Assume that a few systems in one of the given segments 
are compromised. To stop the attack from further spreading, a new 
segment can be created, and the compromised systems can be moved to this
 segment, known as a <b>Containment Segment</b>. After you move the 
compromised systems to this segment, you contain the attack within this 
segment if you implement strict firewall rules. The biggest benefit you 
get is that you can perform a live analysis of the ongoing attack.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-147"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m22-c-6" src="InitialPhasesofIncidentResponse_files/image-m22-c-6.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 Diagram of Network Segmentation"><figcaption>Figure 3.2 Diagram of Network Segmentation: Showing the network segmentation with a containment segment.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-148"><b>Isolation</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-149">Isolation works in a slightly different way than 
segmentation. Even though segmentation limits the attacker's ability to 
proceed further, you may have to use stronger measures to limit the 
attack. One method that can be used as a stronger measure is isolation. 
Two types of isolation can be applied:</p>

<ul id="cn-m22-150">

<li id="cn-m22-150">Isolating the affected systems</li>

<li id="cn-m22-151">Isolating the attacker</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m22-152"><b><i>Isolating the Affected Systems</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m22-153">In this method, the segment that contains the 
compromised systems is completely disconnected and isolated from the 
rest of the network. The systems in the isolated segment can communicate
 with each other, and therefore, the attacker is still able to access 
all these systems. However, access to the other segments is missing 
because this particular segment is now completely isolated. The 
compromised systems can still have access to the Internet. In this mode,
 the attacker can continue to access the compromised systems, but cannot
 proceed beyond the other systems on the network as the segment is 
isolated.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-154"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m22-c-7" src="InitialPhasesofIncidentResponse_files/image-m22-c-7.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3 Diagram of Network Segmentation"><figcaption>Figure 3.3 Diagram of Network Segmentation: Showing the network segmentation with an isolated segment.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<h4 id="cn-m22-155"><b><i>Isolating the Attacker</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m22-156">In the isolating the attacker mode, a honeypot 
environment is configured. It contains “real look-alike data” and 
applications, which may attract the attacker. A honeypot is a decoy or a
 trap created by organizations to attract hackers into a computer 
system. One of the main objectives of using a honeypot is to monitor the
 hacker exploit the vulnerabilities of the system, then subsequently 
learn the weaknesses of the system, and apply the necessary security 
measures to strengthen it from future attacks. While the attacker is
