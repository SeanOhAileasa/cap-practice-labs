<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m6-40"><b>Exercise 1 - Scanning Parameters and Criteria</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m6-41">Before you start with vulnerability scanning, there are
 several factors that you have to think about. You have to define the 
scope of the vulnerability scan. You have to also think about the kind 
of vulnerability scanning that needs to be performed. For example, it 
could be that you are going to perform agent-based vulnerability 
scanning. You have to keep several considerations in mind before you 
take a step forward to perform vulnerability scanning.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-42">In this exercise, you will learn about various scanning parameters and criteria.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m6-44">After completing this exercise, you will have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m6-45">

<li id="cn-m6-45">Risks Associated with Scanning Activities</li>

<li id="cn-m6-46">Vulnerability Feeds</li>

<li id="cn-m6-47">Scope</li>

<li id="cn-m6-48">Credentialed vs. Non-Credentialed</li>

<li id="cn-m6-49">Server-Based vs. Agent-Based</li>

<li id="cn-m6-50">Internal vs. External Scanning</li>

<li id="cn-m6-51">Special Considerations</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m6-52"><b>Risks Associated With Scanning Activities</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-53">Even though vulnerability scanning has the intent of 
finding vulnerabilities, it also has certain risks associated with it. 
Vulnerability scanning must be scoped out correctly. Even though 
vulnerability scanning is easy to perform and is done through automated 
tools, you will still come across several hurdles that need to be dealt 
with. Some of the common hurdles include:</p>

<ul id="cn-m6-54">

<li id="cn-m6-54"><b>Network Bandwidth Consumption</b>: Depending on the
 type of vulnerability scan you perform, it may be a possibility that a 
lot of network bandwidth will get consumed. You have to correctly choose
 the type of vulnerability scan if there is limited network bandwidth. 
For example, if you have a remote location with limited bandwidth, it is
 good to perform an agent-based vulnerability scan.</li>

<li id="cn-m6-55"><b>Business Process Interruption</b>: You need to be 
aware of the type of business processes that are running. While running a
 vulnerability scan on a server or Web application, it may be possible 
that there is a business process interruption. For example, the server 
may get busy in vulnerability scanning, and therefore, resources are 
unavailable for other uses.</li>

<li id="cn-m6-56"><b>Operational Schedules</b>: While planning a 
vulnerability scan, you need to be aware of the operational schedules. 
The vulnerability scan must not interfere with the servers and Web 
applications during the operational time. Therefore, you need to find 
time when the servers and Web applications will be in an idle state.</li>

<li id="cn-m6-57"><b>Correct Scoping</b>: There is a possibility that 
you may want to scan the entire infrastructure. However, it may not be 
required. Therefore, you have to carefully scope out the vulnerability 
scan. If you want to scan the entire infrastructure, then do it in 
phases. You should scan critical assets first and then scan the others 
in phases.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m6-58"><b>Vulnerability Feed</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-59">It is a difficult task for an individual or an 
organization to keep up with the discovered vulnerabilities. An 
individual or the organization would be most concerned with 
vulnerabilities of applications or operating systems that they are 
using. However, it is difficult to keep abreast of the vulnerabilities 
of even a limited number of applications or operating systems.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-60">For example, letâ€™s assume that a new vulnerability has 
been discovered in Windows Server, but you are unaware of it. You have 
several Windows Server systems that are exposed to the Internet. In such
 a scenario, these systems are likely to be compromised if the 
vulnerability is not patched. Therefore, the organizations or even the 
individuals should keep up with the vulnerabilities as and when they are
 discovered.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-61">Vulnerability feeds are a good method to get the latest information about vulnerabilities. Vulnerability feeds are <b>Simple Syndication (RSS) </b>feeds that deliver the information once you subscribe to them. For example, <b>mitre.org </b>has a list of vulnerabilities on Windows:</p>

<p id="cn-m6-62"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m6-c-1" src="TypesofScanning_files/image-m6-c-1.jpg" alt="Figure 1.1 Diagram showing a list of vulnerabilities"><figcaption>Figure
 1.1 Diagram showing a list of vulnerabilities: Showing the list of 
vulnerabilities for Windows and Windows-based applications.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m6-63">When you click on a vulnerability, you can get much information. For example, on <b>mitre.org</b>, you can view a vulnerability by simply clicking on it.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-64"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m6-c-2" src="TypesofScanning_files/image-m6-c-2.jpg" alt="Figure 1.2 Diagram showing a vulnerability"><figcaption>Figure 1.2 Diagram showing a vulnerability: Showing a detailed description of vulnerability on mitre.org.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-90"><b>Scope</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-91">Before performing a vulnerability scan, you need to define:</p>

<ul id="cn-m6-92">

<li id="cn-m6-92">The type of scan that you can perform</li>

<li id="cn-m6-93">The assets that you can scan</li>

<li id="cn-m6-94">Time of the scan</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m6-95">It is critical to define the scope of a vulnerability 
scan. Without defining the scope, you may end up scanning devices or 
applications that you should not be scanning. For example, you may scan 
an application that is owned by a third party. Or, you may end up 
scanning a hardware device that is not in your direct control and is 
owned by the third party.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-96">Defining the scope limits the vulnerability scan to 
focus on specific applications or devices on the network. With the 
scope, you also get limited results, which will be easy to view.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-97"><b>Credentialed vs. Non-Credentialed</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-98">After you have defined the scope of the vulnerability 
scanning, you also need to decide whether you will be performing a 
credentialed or non-credentialed scan. Depending on your requirement, 
you can choose either one. There are advantages and disadvantages to 
using both of them.</p>

<ul id="cn-m6-99">

<li id="cn-m6-99"><b>Credentialed Scan</b>: To run a credentialed scan, 
you need to have the administrative account and use it during the scan. A
 vulnerability scanner using the administrative credentials can probe 
deeper into the network and the applications.</li>

<li id="cn-m6-100"><b>Non-Credentialzed Scan</b>: There are no 
credentials required for this type of vulnerability scan. There is a 
limited amount of scanning that can be done by the non-credentialed scan
 because it cannot scan deeper into the applications or systems that 
require credentialed access. It is mainly focused on finding the open 
ports and the services or software that are using the ports.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m6-101"><b>Server-based vs. Agent-based</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-102">There are two types of vulnerability scanners. The 
first type is the one that uses agents, and the second one is the type 
that does not use agents, which means that the scanners are agentless 
and are known as server-based.</p>

<ul id="cn-m6-103">

<li id="cn-m6-103"><b>Agent-based</b>: An agent is installed on the 
systems that need to be scanned by the vulnerability scanner. The agents
 use the push technology to push the information to the server. 
Agent-based vulnerability scanners are good for locations that have 
limited bandwidth. Some policies are defined on the centralized server 
for the agents based on which they perform the scanning.</li>

<li id="cn-m6-104"><b>Server-based</b>: This type of vulnerability 
scanners do not use an agent and use the pull technology to pull 
information from the systems that need to be scanned. The server-based 
vulnerability scanners are good for locations that have a good amount of
 bandwidth. There is a centralized server that controls the scanning 
part and presents the information in the reports, which can be generated
 or viewed on the server.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m6-105"><b>Internal vs. External</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-106">A vulnerability scan can be either internal or 
external to an organization. When it is external to an organization, it 
means that the vulnerability scan is executed from outside of a network.
 Its main purpose is to scan the perimeter defense and find the 
vulnerability. Some of the key security devices that you would scan are 
firewalls, edge router, or even the Web Application Firewall (<b>WAF</b>).</p>

<p id="cn-m6-107">An internal vulnerability scan is carried out within 
the network, which means that you are running a scan while you are 
connected to the network. The key intent is to try to penetrate the 
perimeter network and also the network devices and services.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-108"><b>Special Considerations</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-109">When running a vulnerability scan, several 
considerations will require your attention. Some of the key 
considerations are listed below.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-110"><b><i>Types of data</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-111">Vulnerability scanners can scan through a vast variety
 of data. However, you need to be aware that the more types of data you 
include in the scan, the more time consuming the scan becomes, and you 
may also end up with the irrelevant results. Therefore, you must 
carefully select the type of data that you want to scan. With the 
filtered data types, you will get more relevant results, and scans are 
faster in generating the results.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-112"><b><i>Technical constraints</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-113">When running a vulnerability scan, there can be several technical constraints. Some of the key constraints are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m6-114">

<li id="cn-m6-114"><b>Licensing restrictions</b>: Depending on the type 
of product that you are using, you may have restrictions on running 
several scans per day or within a given period.</li>

<li id="cn-m6-115"><b>Several target assets</b>: There may be a limitation on the number of target assets that you can scan.</li>

<li id="cn-m6-116"><b>Availability of resources or assets</b>: There can
 be a possibility that a certain set of assets or resources are not 
available at the time of the scan. For example, a live Web server may 
not be available for scanning.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m6-117"><b><i>Workflow</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-118">There can be possibilities that a discovered 
vulnerability may disrupt business operations because of its high 
severity. You also need to get the development team, the network team, 
and the security teams involved in fixing the vulnerability. The idle 
workflow needs to follow these steps:</p>

<p id="cn-m6-119"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m6-c-10" src="TypesofScanning_files/image-m6-c-10.jpg" alt="Figure 1.10 Diagram showing the Vulnerability Scan workflow"><figcaption>Figure
 1.10 Diagram showing the Vulnerability Scan workflow: Showing the three
 main steps in the vulnerability scan workflow which are Detect &gt; 
Remediate &gt; Test.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m6-120">First, you need to run the vulnerability scan to 
detect the vulnerabilities. Then, you need to remediate the 
vulnerabilities, and finally, test whether the vulnerabilities are 
closed.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-121">In this workflow, you need to ensure that there is 
minimal impact on business operations. Therefore, to be able to do this,
 the organization may decide on the frequency of the vulnerability scan 
to be half-yearly or maybe yearly.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-122"><b><i>Sensitivity levels</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-123">Vulnerability tools typically have sensitivity levels.
 However, it may be possible that as per your network architecture, 
vulnerability is not defined with the correct sensitivity level.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-124">There can also be the possibility that vulnerability 
is a false alarm. Therefore, you must review each vulnerability that is 
discovered. The sensitivity level is about how deep a system is probed 
in the vulnerability scan. A scan can be performed at the top-level to 
discover the assets that exist on the network. Such a scan is known as a
 discovery scan.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-125">The second type of scan is the assessment scan in 
which the actual vulnerability scanning takes place. It performs an 
in-depth scan of the systems and applications and can locate the 
vulnerabilities.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-126"><b><i>Regulatory requirements</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-127">There can be a possibility that your organization is complying with a specific regulation, such as <b>PCI-DSS</b>. In such a case, the frequency of the vulnerability scan will be determined by <b>PCI-DSS</b>, which requires a quarterly scan.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-128">Other regulatory requirements, such as <b>FISMA</b>, also mandates a specific frequency of the vulnerability scan. Some regulations, such as <b>HIPAA</b>, do not mandate the requirement of a vulnerability scan.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-129">It is also possible that an internal security policy 
mandates the vulnerability scan to be run at a specific frequency. Such a
 requirement is common amongst several organizations.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-130"><b><i>Segmentation</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-131">Most organizations will break their large networks 
into several segments. Each segment will be running a specific type of 
resource. For example, a particular segment may be running only the 
desktops.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-132">On the other hand, another segment may be running on the servers.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-133">When planning the vulnerability scan, you must scope 
all required segments and consider the segments that need to be included
 in the vulnerability scan. There can also be the possibility that a 
segment with a critical Web server is isolated from the network. You 
also need to include this particular segment into the vulnerability 
scan, and therefore, you must plan accordingly.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-134"><b><i>Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and Firewall </i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-135">Several organizations deploy active protection and detection security controls, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m6-136">

<li id="cn-m6-136">Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)</li>

<li id="cn-m6-137">Intrusion Detection System (IDS)</li>

<li id="cn-m6-138">Web Application Firewall</li>

<li id="cn-m6-139">Firewalls</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m6-140">When running a vulnerability scan, these active 
protection and detection security controls may raise a false alarm 
during the vulnerability scan. You should attempt to avoid any kind of 
interference with these security controls during the vulnerability scan.</p>
