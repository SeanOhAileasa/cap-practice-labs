<p id="cn-m5-43">A threat is something that can potentially take 
advantage of a vulnerability to gain an advantage in altering, 
modifying, or deleting data or information. A threat source is someone 
who triggers a threat, which can either be intentional or unintentional.
 A threat actor can also trigger the threat to execute.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-44">It is important to understand that a threat is a 
probability, which has not been executed or triggered. It is a 
probability that is likely to happen and exploit the vulnerability or 
opportunity to take its advantage. A threat, in simplest terms, is meant
 to harm, has to be triggered by someone who is the threat actor. A 
threat cannot act on its own. Someone has to trigger it.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-45">There can be different types of threats, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-46">

<li id="cn-m5-46"><b>Intentional</b>: Triggered by an attacker</li>

<li id="cn-m5-47"><b>Unintentional</b>: Triggered accidentally by someone, such as accidentally deleting data</li>

<li id="cn-m5-48"><b>Natural</b>: Triggered by a natural threat, such as flood or hurricane</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m5-49">In this exercise, you will learn about the threat data and intelligence.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m5-51">After completing this exercise, you will have further knowledge of:</p>

<h3 id="cn-m5-60"><b>Zero-day Vulnerabilities</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m5-61">Software typically has vulnerabilities. Some 
vulnerabilities are known and patched by the software vendor, however, 
some vulnerabilities are discovered and then exploited (in most cases) 
by different entities, such as security researchers or hackers. The 
vulnerabilities are not known to anyone, including the software vendors,
 and can be exploited; these are known as zero-day attacks.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-62">It is important to note that a zero-day vulnerability 
is difficult to patch because, for a single reason that you cannot patch
 a vulnerability that does not exist. Remember that the software vendor 
does not know that the vulnerability exists and, therefore, cannot 
prepare and roll out an update to patch it.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-63">A zero-day vulnerability can exist natively within 
operating systems or applications. Hackers typically look out for 
unknown vulnerabilities, and when they find it, they exploit it for 
certain benefits, such as unauthorized access to data and systems. Some 
hackers may ask for a reward from the software vendor, and if not paid, 
they may sell it to other entities or exploit it themselves.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-64">Microsoft runs a <b>Security Notification Service</b>, 
which aims to send out critical notifications of Zero-Day threats as 
they occur to keep security professionals as up to date as possible so 
that they can be patched and actioned accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m5-82"><b>Threat Categories</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m5-83">A threat can occur due to different reasons. Therefore,
 you can classify a threat into three different categories, 
technological threats; which includes the Internet, E-mail, Software 
Vulnerabilities and Removable Media, human threats; which can be 
intentional and unintentional, and disaster-related threats; both 
natural and man-made.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-84"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m5-c-7" src="ThreatData_files/image-m5-c-7.jpg" alt="Figure 1.6 Diagram showing the hierarchy of threats"><figcaption>Figure
 1.6 Diagram showing the hierarchy of threats: Showing the three main 
categories of threats and then also showing the sub-categories of each 
of the categories.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m5-85">Let’s look at each of them in detail.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-86"><b><i>Technological Factors</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-87">Various threats occur because of various technical 
factors. With the new advancements in technology, new threats keep 
emerging. The main sources of threats in technology are</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-88">

<li id="cn-m5-88"><b>Internet</b>: Is the main threat source. Several 
attacks occur using the Internet. If your servers are present on the 
Internet, they can be vulnerable to several threats, such as 
denial-of-service (DoS) or Distributed DoS (DDs).</li>

<li id="cn-m5-89"><b>Email</b>: Is considered to be the main carrier of a
 major threat, which is malware. Millions of users receive Emails with 
malicious software, which gets triggered when the users click on them. 
The malicious software or malware is designed to infiltrate data from 
the system or the network.</li>

<li id="cn-m5-90"><b>Software Vulnerabilities </b>Are the main source of
 threats in applications and operating systems. If the vulnerabilities 
are not patched, then they can be exploited by the threat actors.</li>

<li id="cn-m5-91"><b>Removable media</b>: Is another main source of 
malware. If a removable media is infected with malware, when plugged 
into a system, it can also infect the system.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m5-92"><b><i>Human</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-93">These are individuals or groups of individuals are who 
exploit the threat. These individuals can be the main source of threats 
inadvertently or deliberately. For example, a novice hacker hacks into a
 live Website to test his or her skills. This is an inadvertent act. On 
the other hand, a hacker exploits a vulnerability and gains access to 
the application or system is the deliberate act.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-94">Threats in this category can also be further classified
 as internal or external. An internal employee who accidentally deletes 
the critical data perform the inadvertently act. On the other hand, an 
internal employee who deletes a critical folder before leaving the 
organization performs the deliberate act. Threats, such as a hacker, can
 be considered as an external threat source.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-95"><b><i>Disasters</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-96">A disaster can either be human-made or natural. 
Earthquake, flood, and storm natural threats that cannot be controlled. 
They are beyond any human control. On the other hand, human-made 
disasters are threats that can be controlled. For example, a riot breaks
 out in the same region that has your datacenter. This type of disaster 
can still be prevented.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-97"><b><i>Threat Classifications</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-98">Threats can also be classified into different types. These are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-99">

<li id="cn-m5-99">Zero-day vulnerabilities</li>

<li id="cn-m5-100">Known threats vs. unknown threats</li>

<li id="cn-m5-101">Advanced Persistent Threats (ATP)</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m5-102">We have already discussed Zero-day vulnerabilities, so let’s look at the others in more detail.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-103"><b><i>Known Threat vs. Unknown Threat</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-104">A threat can be known or unknown. A known one is a 
threat that the organization has encountered before or has the security 
controls to tackle it if it occurs. A good example in this context would
 be DDoS that can occur and is a known threat. The organization knows 
that if proper security controls are not implemented, a DDoS attack can 
occur. Therefore, the organization configures the security controls, 
such as a firewall.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-105">Unknown threats, on the other hand, is a type of 
threat that is not known to the organization, which has to actively 
monitor the infrastructure and try to locate them. A zero-day 
vulnerability can be an example of an unknown threat. It is not known to
 the organization, but there is a high possibility that it may be 
present in the applications that the organization uses. Unknown threats 
usually occur because the attackers continue to find new methods to 
conduct the attacks.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-106">There is quite a possibility that the organization’s 
infrastructure may also fail to detect a known threat. This can happen 
because the defensive security controls fail to detect the known threat.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-107"><b><i>Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-108">In a traditional attack, a hacker gets into the 
system, does the damage, and moves out. However, APT attacks are 
different. The attacker gains access to the system or network and stays 
there for a long time without being detected. The security controls fail
 to detect APT attacks.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-109">Unlike the traditional attack, which may cause damage 
to the system or network and get detected in a short period, the APT 
attacks quietly keep exfiltrating the data without being detected. The 
APT attacks usually do not cause damage and, therefore, do not attract 
attention. Since there are no noticeable activities within the systems 
or the network, these attacks go unnoticed and manage to exist within 
the network or system for a long time.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-110">APT attacks have several characteristics that set them apart from traditional threats:</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-111">

<li id="cn-m5-111">Well-targeted</li>

<li id="cn-m5-112">Data focused</li>

<li id="cn-m5-113">Looks for high-value information</li>

<li id="cn-m5-114">Un-detectable</li>

<li id="cn-m5-115">Well organized</li>

<li id="cn-m5-116">Well-funded</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m5-117">People conducting APTs are highly skilled and use sophisticated methods. They look for valuable information, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-118">

<li id="cn-m5-118">Intellectual property (IP) secrets</li>

<li id="cn-m5-119">Design</li>

<li id="cn-m5-120">Critical business information</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m5-121">It is not necessary that the APTs only focus on the 
large organization for data. They can also target political parties and 
even nations. With the nations, they can target critical 
infrastructures, such as the power grid or the nuclear facilities. Below
 is a diagram of the process that ATP follows, from defining and 
researching targets, compiling intrusions, compromising user 
credentials, moving laterally, staying low profile, exfiltrating data 
and covering your tracks:</p>

<p id="cn-m5-122"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m5-c-8" src="ThreatData_files/image-m5-c-8.jpg" alt="Figure 1.7 Diagram showing the ATP process"><figcaption>Figure 1.7 Diagram showing the ATP process: Showing the various stages of an ATP attack.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<h3 id="cn-m5-123"><b>Threat Actor</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m5-124">Threat actors are the entities who are the originators of the threats. Threat actor can be:</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-125">

<li id="cn-m5-125">Internal, such as disgruntled employees</li>

<li id="cn-m5-126">Malicious intruders, such as hackers</li>

<li id="cn-m5-127">Natural disasters, such as floods</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m5-128">Threat actors can be individuals or groups. These can 
range from a script kiddie, which uses scripts developed by someone, to 
someone who is highly expert in conducting attacks, such as a 
nation-state. A script kiddie would be low skilled, but when a 
nation-state would use highly advanced methods of conducting attacks.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-129">There can be different types of threat actors, which 
could be either internal or external. It is important to understand that
 every threat actor can use different types of threat vectors, which are
 the methods used by the threat actors. Threat vectors also include 
processes and tools that are used by the threat actors. Threat actors 
can be of different types, such as external and internal. Let’s look at 
each one of them.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-130"><b><i>External</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-131">These are typically hackers, script kiddies, 
hacktivists, and nation-states. The external threat actors have the goal
  of exploiting the vulnerabilities and the systems. The external threat
 actors can be individuals, groups, or organizations, who, by illegal 
means, access the systems and networks that they are not authorized to 
access.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-132">Mostly, except for the script kiddies, the external 
threat actors use sophisticated methods to conduct attacks. They have 
custom tools for attacking the organizations, political parties, or the 
government infrastructure.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-133"><b><i>Internal </i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-134">The internal threat actors are the ones who are part 
of an organization. They intentionally or unintentionally cause damage 
to an organization. As part of the organization, they are typically 
employees or third-party vendors who have access to the resources. The 
threat generated by the internal threat actors can be intentional or 
unintentional.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-135"><b><i>Third-Party Vendors / Partners </i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-136">Other than external or internal threat actors, they 
are third-party vendors or partners who have a deep association with the
 organization. They also have access to the resources within the 
organization. Therefore, they can also be a threat actor by causing 
intentional or unintentional damage to the organization’s resources.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-137"><b><i>Nation-state</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-138">Nation-states are known for their cyber espionage 
against the nations. They are hired by a government to conduct an attack
 against the government of another nation. These are hackers who have 
sophisticated methods and techniques that they use to conduct the 
attacks and can target some of the following:</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-139">

<li id="cn-m5-139">Government agencies</li>

<li id="cn-m5-140">Critical infrastructure</li>

<li id="cn-m5-141">Industries with sensitive data or property</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m5-142">In most cases, the nation-state hackers use custom 
tools and target the zero-day vulnerabilities and other vulnerabilities 
that have been known but are still present in the application and 
operating system.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-143">One of the key attributes of the nation-state is that 
they are highly covert, and therefore, most of the attacks conducted by 
them rarely come into the news. They, however, are highly focused and 
have a set target whom they exploit.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-144"><b><i>Hacktivist</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-145">A hacktivist is a hacker who performs hacking for 
either a political reason or wants to bring in a social change. A 
hacktivist may perform a hacking due to the ideological difference with 
the government or a political party. The attacks performed by the 
hacktivist to gain attention towards their ideology or to highlight 
their intention of social change. In most basic terms, you can call them
 the Internet version of activists.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-146">A hacktivist can also be part of a group that acts as a
 team. They often use simple methods of attacks. Distributed Denial of 
Service or DDoS or DoS is often a key method of attack on the 
government’s Web infrastructure, such as government portals.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-147">Most famous hacktivist groups:</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-148">

<li id="cn-m5-148"><b>Anonymous</b>: Known for famous attacks, such as 
Fine Gael website, Operation Tunisia, Operation Egypt, Operation Syria, 
Operation DarkNet, AntiSec Leak, and CIA attack.</li>

<li id="cn-m5-149"><b>LulzSec</b>: Known for famous attacks, such as Sony data breach, and Sony PlayStation Network hack.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m5-150"><b><i>Organized Crime</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-151">organized crime turns out to be one of the biggest 
threats on the Internet. Unlike some hackers, who are into hacking for 
either fun or causing some level of damage, the organized crime hackers 
are serious criminals. They have moved away from the traditional crimes 
to hacking in cyberspace. Organized criminals are individuals who are 
multi-skilled and have sophisticated methods in conducting their 
attacks.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-152">The hackers conducting organized crime are no novices 
with basic tools in conducting the attacks. Rather, these guys are into 
causing some of the serious damages to the organizations, such as:</p>

<li id="cn-m5-155">Stealing industrial secrets and confidential organizational information</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m5-156">They use sophisticated tools, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-157">

<li id="cn-m5-157">Botnets</li>

<h4 id="cn-m5-160"><b><i>Insider threat</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-161">Insider threats are generated by the individuals who 
are either the employees of an organization or closely associated with 
the organization as a vendor or third-party. It is difficult to detect 
insider threats because insiders are virtually difficult to detect as 
attackers.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-162">Consider an example when the attacker tried to hack 
into your network. There are various security controls, such as a 
firewall, blocking access. However, in the case of the insider, they do 
not have to face the perimeter security, or the security controls 
configured on the edge of the network. The insiders are already inside 
the network and have access to the various resources on the network.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-163">The insiders are usually not seen as a threat to the 
organization’s resources. They have legitimate access to the resources 
that exist on the network. Several insiders may have more than the 
required access, and they can access and, in some cases, exploit the 
weakness that may exist within the network and its resources.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-164"><b>Motives</b></p>

<p id="cn-m5-165">There are different motives for an insider threat that
 can be divided into two different categories: personal motives and 
organizational factors.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-166">The examples of personal motives can be anger, 
revenge, ideology, divided loyalty, ego, self-image, ingratiation, or 
family problems.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-167">As far as organizational factors are concerned, some 
of the key examples can be time pressure, no training, no classification
 of confidential information, or easy access to the resources or the 
facility of the organization.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-168"><b><i>Types of insiders</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-169">There can be different types of insiders:</p>

<p id="cn-m5-170"><b>Pure Insider</b></p>

<p id="cn-m5-171">A pure insider is a person who is part of the 
organization. He or she is a legitimate user. The pure insider has 
permissions and privileges on the internal network and its resources of 
the organization. The pure insider also has the user account based on 
which he or she connects with the network to access the resources. He or
 she has the most capable of causing maximum damage.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-172"><b>Insider Associate</b></p>

<p id="cn-m5-173">An insider associate is someone who is not directly 
the part of the organization, but he or she is a third-party vendor or a
 contractor. The insider associate can also be the security guard or 
even a receptionist who can be a contractual resource. They can have 
limited access to the network resources or even the facility where your 
organization has the office. For example, a security guard may simply 
have access to the papers that are left in the open on the employees’ 
desk. Some of the papers may contain confidential information. Now, this
 information can be passed on to a malicious entity.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-174"><b>Insider Affiliate</b></p>

<p id="cn-m5-175">An insider affiliate is someone who can be a spouse, a
 friend, or someone who has a connection with an employee. This person 
can obtain the information, such as user credentials or security badge 
from the employee and access the network or even the facility.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-176"><b>Outsider Affiliate</b></p>

<p id="cn-m5-177">The outside affiliates are the external entities, 
which are not employees or do not have a connection with the employee. 
The outsider affiliate can attempt to find the entry into the facility 
or the network using different methods. It could be through obtaining 
credentials of an individual or breaking into a wireless network and 
gaining access to the network.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-178">There can be two types of insider threats:</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-179">

<li id="cn-m5-179">Intentional</li>

<li id="cn-m5-180">Unintentional</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m5-181"><b>Intentional</b></p>

<p id="cn-m5-182">There can be insiders who have access to the internal 
network and also its resources. They are the entities who have a reason 
to conduct malicious intent. Some examples are anger, revenge, ideology,
 divided loyalty, or even the work that he or she is doing.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-183">It could also be that these entities can work for 
personal gain, something like a monetary gain. They may steal the 
information and sell it to outsiders, such as competitors. In some 
cases, these entities have access to confidential and restricted 
information. An example can be a personal assistant to the CEO of the 
organization, who would have access to his various resources, such as 
Email and other confidential information, such as budgets.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-184">If the secretary decides to sell this confidential 
information, or someone simply triggers him/her to share the 
information, then the company’s entire security paradigm becomes simply 
useless.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-185">In this scenario, if the secretary steals and shares 
the information to a malicious entity, the entire set of security 
controls within the organization network or on its perimeter network 
becomes useless.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-186"><b>Unintentional</b></p>

<p id="cn-m5-187">Unintentional insiders are the ones who do not have 
any malicious intentions but accidentally become a threat to the network
 and its resources. It is important to understand that these entities do
 not have any malicious intent, but the activities they perform can be 
malicious even though they are unintentional.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-188">Some of the unintentional activities that may perform are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-189">

<li id="cn-m5-189">Accidental data deletion</li>

<li id="cn-m5-190">Accidental data modification</li>

<li id="cn-m5-191">Incorrect usage of privileges</li>

</ul>

<ol id="cn-m5-192">

</ol>

<p id="cn-m5-193">The consequences of an unintentional act can also be 
as dangerous as the intentional act. For example, a healthcare 
professional makes incorrect modifications to various patients’ data. 
This can be considered a serious mistake because the doctor, based on 
medical history, may end up giving the wrong medicine to the patient. 
Such an unintentional attack may occur due to the lack of attention, but
 the consequences can be serious.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m5-194"><b>Commodity Malware</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m5-195">Malware is typically developed by hackers on their 
own. They develop it keeping a specific attack in mind. Such malware is 
highly customized to meet the requirements of the hackers.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-196">However, it is important to understand that not 
everyone can program malware. In such a situation, a threat actor may 
look for ready-made malware that is available. Such malware that is 
available in the underground malware is known as commodity malware.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-197">The commodity malware can either be free or purchased,
 which are typically available in the underground Web. The threat actor 
can purchase it from the underground Webby, paying some amount in 
cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin. It is also possible that the malware 
can be distributed using online storage platforms, such as GitHub, 
Google Drive, or BitBucket.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-198">However, online storage platforms scan the uploads for
 malware detection. To avoid any type of malware detection, the malware 
developers using various tools:</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-199">

<li id="cn-m5-199">Themida</li>

<li id="cn-m5-200">CypherIT Autoit</li>

<li id="cn-m5-201">Emotet</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m5-202">These applications put an extra layer of protection on the malware, which helps it evade any type the malware detection.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-203">The commodity malware is available in the “as-is” 
model, which means that they are not customized. Such malware is focused
 on the existing vulnerabilities of one or more software.</p>
