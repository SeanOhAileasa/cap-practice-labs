<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m25-54"><b>Exercise 1 - Network-Related</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m25-55">A network comprises several systems, applications, and
 network devices. When a network device or server gets compromised, the 
attacker may attempt to disrupt the other servers and applications. 
There will be several indicators of compromise that may be visible.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-56">In this exercise, you will learn about several indicators of compromise on a network.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m25-58">After completing this exercise, you will have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m25-59">

<li id="cn-m25-59">Bandwidth Consumption</li>

<li id="cn-m25-60">Beaconing</li>

<li id="cn-m25-61">Irregular Peer-To-Peer Communication</li>

<li id="cn-m25-65">Common Protocol Over a Non-Standard Port</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Devices</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m25-67">This exercise contains supporting materials for CySA+.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-68"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m25-c-1" src="NetworkandApplicationRelatedIncidentCompromiseIndicators_files/image-m25-c-1.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m25-69"><b>Bandwidth Consumption</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m25-70">Each network consumes a certain amount of bandwidth 
when connected to the Internet. Certain services will continue to 
consume bandwidth, and as such you must create benchmarks on what normal
 consumption looks like. For example, if there is a Webserver that uses a
 certain amount of bandwidth, you can look at the usage over the last 
few months and create benchmarks.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-71">In a case such as denial-of-service (<b>DoS</b>) and distributed denial-of-service (<b>DDoS</b>)
 attacks, the bandwidth consumption will shoot up. The Webserver will 
have a large number of inbound connections that will also consume a good
 deal of bandwidth. You can configure alerts that should raise the alarm
 if there is bandwidth consumption above the set benchmark.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-72">There are several commercial and free tools available 
that can be used to monitor bandwidth consumption. Some of the free 
tools are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m25-73">

<li id="cn-m25-73">BitMeter OS</li>

<li id="cn-m25-74">Freemeter Bandwidth Monitor</li>

<li id="cn-m25-75">BandwidthD</li>

<li id="cn-m25-76">PRTG Bandwidth Monitor</li>

<li id="cn-m25-77">SolarWinds Real-Time NetFlow Analyzer</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m25-78"><b>Beaconing</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m25-79">When a system becomes compromised, it is usually 
controlled by a command and control center, which requires the 
compromised system to check-in after a set time. In some cases, after 
the compromised system connects to the command and control center, the 
attacker may trigger a few commands to perform several mischievous 
activities, like stealing the data or triggering a denial-of-service 
attack.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-80">When the compromised system is connecting to the 
command and control center at a given interval, it is known as 
beaconing. There is a communication that takes place between the 
compromised system and the command and control center.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-81">The interval of connectivity between the compromised 
system and command and control center is usually after a set time. 
However, an attacker may want to perform a quick task, such as steal the
 data or information before getting detected. Therefore, the interval is
 not set, but it is at the will of the attacker.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-82">Several tools and applications can identify the beaconing process. Some of the key tools are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m25-83">

<li id="cn-m25-83">Edge firewalls</li>

<li id="cn-m25-84">Intrusion detection systems</li>

<li id="cn-m25-85">Web proxies</li>

<li id="cn-m25-86">SIEM</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m25-87">As a recommended practice to stop beaconing, you 
should create an activity baseline on the network. This can help you 
identify unusual activities. For example, the compromised system may be 
connecting with the command and control center in the middle of the 
night, which should raise alerts.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-88">You should also continuously monitor the traffic on 
the network. If a system is sending out traffic at regular intervals to 
an external host, it should be inspected. It is also important to note 
that in most cases, the beaconing traffic mimics the normal traffic. 
Therefore, it is critical to monitor the traffic and identify unusual 
patterns even if it is normal traffic.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m25-89"><b>Irregular Peer-to-Peer Communication</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m25-90">There can be a possibility that there is a 
peer-to-peer communication taking place within the network. It could be 
due to two users sharing files using peer-to-peer communication. Another
 possibility could be that there is a botnet that exists within the 
network that is causing the peer-to-peer communication.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-91">In a normal botnet, there is a command and control 
center that exists on the Internet somewhere. This command and control 
center controls all the bots within a botnet. However, the communication
 within an internal system can be blocked by a firewall, and therefore, 
the normal botnet may not be able to communicate with the compromised 
internal system.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-92">The peer-to-peer botnets are a relatively new concept 
in the botnet domain. In the peer-to-peer botnets, a system that is 
Internet-facing from a network is set as a command and control center, 
which in turn controls the internal compromised systems.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-93">Once again, monitoring network traffic is a good 
option to track peer-to-peer communication. Along with this, you can 
also use either IPS or IDS to monitor suspicious activities, such as 
illegal file-sharing or communication with the command and control 
center.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m25-94"><b>A Rogue Device on the Network</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m25-95">Several times, users tend to bring their own devices 
and plug them on to the network. In several cases, the users may not 
have ill intentions, but while in other cases, the users may be wanting 
to perform malicious activity, like setting up a rogue access point to 
capture the communication.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-96">There can be several devices that can be considered as
 a rogue on the network if the network administrator does not authorize 
them. Some of the rogue devices that you may happen to find on the 
network are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m25-97">

<li id="cn-m25-97">Rogue switches</li>

<li id="cn-m25-98">Mobile hacking gear</li>

<li id="cn-m25-99">Wireless key loggers</li>

<li id="cn-m25-100">Wi-Fi and Bluetooth hacking gear</li>

<li id="cn-m25-101">Rogue wireless access points</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m25-102">Not all the rogue devices can be located and 
prevented on the network with a single solution. For example, to ensure 
that the rogue switches cannot be connected to the network, you need to 
hard code the trunks and disable the <b>Dynamic Trunking Protocol </b>(<b>DTP</b>) on the switch ports. This must be done on all switches that are connected to the network.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-103">When referring to the rogue wireless access points, you should use the <b>Wireless Intrusion Prevention System </b>(<b>WIPS</b>), which can track any rogue wireless access points on the network.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m25-104"><b>Scan/Sweep</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m25-105">A user on the network may run an unauthorized scan of
 the network to verify the live systems and to check which all ports are
 open on these systems. If an unauthorized scan sweep occurs, it could 
indicate that someone might be preparing for a penetration test, even 
though you do not have any knowledge of it. This could be an 
unauthorized penetration test or hack that might be on its way. For 
example, someone might just run the ping or ICMP sweeps to verify all 
the live systems on the network. In another case, someone might just run
 a port scan to verify which all ports are open on the live systems. 
Another example is that someone might run a vulnerability scan on live 
systems to locate vulnerabilities that have not been closed. These 
vulnerabilities can be a target for exploitation.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-106">You need to continuously monitor network traffic, and
 also enable logging through SIEM, which can help you detect such 
activities through logs. You can also implement IDS to detect any such 
traffic on the network.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m25-107"><b>Unusual Traffic Spikes</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m25-108">Unusual traffic spikes can arise in network traffic. 
There can be legitimate reasons, such as updates being downloaded, 
backups being performed, antivirus being updated. There could be several
 legitimate issues. However, you need to know the pattern of these 
legitimate spikes in traffic, which can be done by benchmarking or 
creating the network traffic baselining.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-109">Then, there are unusual and illegitimate traffic 
spikes. These could cause deviations from the standard benchmarks and 
baselines. Therefore, you need to continuously review the network 
traffic and verify whether it is legitimate or illegitimate. A 
denial-of-service attack can cause illegitimate traffic spikes.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m25-110"><b>Common Protocol Over a Non-Standard Port</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m25-111">There can be a possibility that an attacker may be 
running a malware or any malicious application using a common protocol, 
such as <b>HTTP </b>or <b>HTTPS</b>. However, most such applications would not run on the standard port, which could be port <b>80 </b>for <b>HTTP </b>and <b>port 443 </b>for <b>HTTPS</b>.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-112">The attacker may run the application using a non-standard port, let’s say port <b>8080 </b>or <b>8181 </b>for <b>HTTP</b>.
 Depending on the type of application or malware that is running, it is 
quite a high possibility that there will be a non-standard port that 
will be used.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-113">Therefore, when monitoring traffic, you should 
monitor and review it carefully and locate any non-standard port being 
used. If there is something that is not in your knowledge, it is worth a
 check.</p>

compromise.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-128"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m25-c-2" src="NetworkandApplicationRelatedIncidentCompromiseIndicators_files/image-m25-c-2.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m25-129"><b>Anomalous Activity</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m25-130">There can be different forms of anomalous activities 
in a system. It could be that the applications stop working, such as an 
antivirus. It could also be that some critical data is deleted without 
your knowledge. If there are certain cases like that you do not expect, 
you can suspect anomalous activities.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-131">One of the best methods to track anomalous activities
 is to baseline your system. If there is new malware being installed or 
added to your system, you can check your system configuration against 
the baseline and figure out the anomalous activities.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m25-132"><b>Introduction of New Accounts</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m25-133">There can be different places where the user accounts
 can exist. It could be a directory server, such as a domain controller,
 or it could be the local system. Other than these, there can be a 
database for an application that contains the user accounts. For 
example, you choose to keep your application related accounts in an <b>SQL Server database</b>.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-134">As a standard practice, you should be reviewing these
 accounts regularly. In many cases, the attacker creates a new user 
account to gain entry into the system. You can consider this as a 
backdoor entry into the system. It could also be a possibility that the 
malware created the user account with administrative access in the 
system.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m25-135"><b>Unexpected Outputs</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m25-136">Each application is designed to work and generate 
output in a certain way. The output has a certain format that is 
consistent. However, if you get output that is not as expected, for 
example, corrupt output or dialog boxes with strange messages, you can 
expect the system to be infected with malware.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-137">In such a scenario, you can suspect that the malware 
has altered the application that is either displaying the dialog boxes 
with strange messages or generating corrupt output. You should 
immediately take the system off the network and perform a thorough 
scanning of the system. It would be advisable to use at least two 
antivirus or antimalware scanners. If the application continues to 
behave in the same way, you should format the system and re-install it.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m25-138"><b>Unexpected Outbound Communication</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m25-139">As a security professional, you should be 
consistently monitoring the network, specifically the traffic that is 
outbound. During monitoring, if you see a large amount of outbound 
traffic, you should immediately inspect the traffic. There is a high 
possibility that malware or a malicious entity is sending out the 
traffic to their systems. This traffic could include confidential data 
from your organization.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-140">In such a scenario, you should inspect the firewall 
rules and block the outbound traffic to the system. You should also 
locate the internal system that is sending the traffic and isolate it 
from the network. Then, you should perform a thorough check on the 
system, and there is a high possibility that you will find malware 
within the system.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m25-141"><b>Service Interruption</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m25-142">If multiple services are failing or behaving 
abnormally on your system, you should inspect the system without a 
second thought. It is a good idea to check the event logs and figure out
 the reason that is causing the applications to fail.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-143">As a precautionary measure, it is good to scan the system with an updated antimalware.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m25-144"><b>Application Logs</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m25-145">The Application log in windows contains the 
application-specific entries. Any event that takes place with an 
application is logged in the Application log. For example, you have 
updated an application with a newer version. The update requires the 
system to be restarted for changes to take effect. In such a scenario, 
the event regarding the restart is logged in the Application log.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-146"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m25-c-3" src="NetworkandApplicationRelatedIncidentCompromiseIndicators_files/image-m25-c-3.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1"><figcaption>Figure 2.1: Showing the Microsoft Event Viewer.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m25-147">If there are abnormal shutdowns or failures of an application, such events are also logged in the Application log.</p>

<p id="cn-m25-148"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m25-c-4" src="NetworkandApplicationRelatedIncidentCompromiseIndicators_files/image-m25-c-4.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2"><figcaption>Figure 2.2: Exhibit of the Event Viewer: Showing an error in the Application log in the Event Viewer</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m25-149">When the applications are not behaving as expected, 
the first check you should perform is in the Application log. Here, you 
are likely to gain the real cause of the error.</p>
