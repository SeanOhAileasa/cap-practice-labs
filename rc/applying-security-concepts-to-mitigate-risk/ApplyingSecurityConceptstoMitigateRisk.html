<p id="cn-m28-40">A Business Impact Analysis (BIA) is a process that 
helps to identify critical business functions that are running within an
 organization. Along with identifying these functions, it also helps to 
determine the impact if any function goes down. Using the BIA process, 
you can minimize the potential loss due to an unexpected event. By 
developing the BIA, you can devise recovery strategies and implement 
them to limit the possible loss.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-41">When you complete the BIA process within your 
organization, you can determine the risks that may occur in a disaster. 
You can implement the BIA process in a manger that each department 
within the organization is involved and determines the impact of 
specific risks. After the departments have decided on the risks, you can
 calculate the effect of these risks. You can then prioritize the 
functions that need more attention and protection. Going ahead, you can 
calculate the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective
 (RTO) to prioritize the functions.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-42">RPO defines the tolerance level for an organization to
 which they can revert to an older version of data. It is the maximum 
amount of data you can afford to lose in case of a disaster.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-43">RTO is the time during which the disrupted service or 
server must be restored. It should be the maximum time to restore 
service to its operations.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-44">Both the RTO and RPO must be defined in the BIA process.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-50"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m28-c-1" src="ApplyingSecurityConceptstoMitigateRisk_files/image-m28-c-1.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m28-51"><b>Business Impact Analysis (BIA)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m28-52">Business Impact Analysis or BIA is a critical task 
that needs to be performed as part of the Business Continuity and 
Recovery Planning process. You need to perform BIA if you want to 
discover the essential business processes that are highly critical for 
running the business. If any of these business processes are 
unavailable, then the function related to the business process may 
become non-functional.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-53">Let’s see how BIA fits into the Business Continuity 
and Recovery Planning process, which has multiple steps that must be 
performed to complete the process:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-54">

<li id="cn-m28-54">Risk Assessment</li>

<li id="cn-m28-55">Business Impact Analysis (BIA)</li>

<li id="cn-m28-56">Business Continuity Plan Development</li>

<li id="cn-m28-57">Strategy and Plan Development</li>

<li id="cn-m28-58">Plan&nbsp;Testing &amp; Maintenance</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m28-59">In the given series of steps that need to be performed
 as part of the Business Continuity and Recovery Planning process, BIA 
occurs in the initial phases. In the BIA phase, you list down the 
recovery assumptions, which include the RTO and RPOs. You also list the 
critical business functions and processes and their interdependence. For
 example, a process may be dependent on an internal or external entity. A
 software development team has outsourced the entire application 
development to a third-party vendor. Now, there is a dependence on the 
external entity. If, due to some unforeseen circumstance, the 
third-party vendor is no longer available, then it is a huge risk for 
the software development team as it will not be able to complete the 
project.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-60">When performing the BIA task, you need to assess the 
financial and non-financial cost-based functions within the 
organization. However, even though the organizations may have several 
functions, some functions will always be more critical than the other 
functions. Depending upon their criticality, you will have to give these
 functions more priority when creating the BIA.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-61">It is important to note that BIA must be done in 
advance. BIA is not something that you perform when a disaster strikes. 
You need to be ready with the identification of key processes and the 
impact they can cause due to their unavailability. It is important to 
remember that BIA is not a solution to any risk or disaster, but a tool 
that helps an organization’s management focus on critical business 
functions. When you perform BIA, you get the following information:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-62">

<li id="cn-m28-62">Critical functions</li>

<li id="cn-m28-63">Critical systems and services</li>

<li id="cn-m28-64">Dependencies that may exist within functions or systems</li>

<li id="cn-m28-65">RTO and RPO</li>

<li id="cn-m28-66">Scenarios that can negatively impact the functions of systems and the loss that can be caused by them</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m28-67"><b><i>BIA Considerations</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-68">The BIA considers various scenarios. For example, it would consider the following:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-69">

<li id="cn-m28-69"><b>Natural disasters: </b>Flood, hurricane, earthquake</li>

<li id="cn-m28-70"><b>Accidental disasters: </b>Fire, power outage</li>

<li id="cn-m28-71"><b>Human-made errors: </b>data deletion</li>

<li id="cn-m28-72"><b>System errors: </b>system failure, hard drive failure</li>

<li id="cn-m28-73"><b>Intentional errors: </b>system hacks, data thefts</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m28-74">The above-given scenarios are not an exhaustive list, 
but enough to highlight that the risks can occur in multiple scenarios. 
It is important to highlight that the risks are not always technical and
 relate to several other things, such as intentional errors and so on. 
When you define the scenarios, you can use BIA to calculate the impact. 
The BIA attempts to identify the impact of these scenarios.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-75">Let’s take an example. Your organization has an online
 e-commerce Web application for selling products. It has a database in 
the backend that collects the payment through online transfers or credit
 or debit cards. A hacker can exploit a vulnerability in this Web 
application and gain access to the customer data. What is likely to be 
the impact of this attack?</p>

<p id="cn-m28-76">The organization may have to incur the cost in 
millions of dollars to fix the vulnerability, repair the reputational 
damage, or even responding to the lawsuits. Also, there will be costly 
in terms of losing the business because customers are now afraid to 
share personal data with your organization. You may end up paying money 
as a resolution to the lawsuits.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-77">If you had a BIA process in place, it would have been 
easy for the organization to identify the critical business processes. 
In this entire scenario, the system hosting the Web application is 
critical, along with the Web application itself. Running the Web 
application itself was a process in itself along with the sub-processes,
 such as how to configure the server or how to configure the Web 
application.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-78">The BIA identifies mission-essential functions and 
critical systems that are essential to the organization’s success. It 
also identifies maximum downtime limits for these systems and 
components, various scenarios that can impact these systems and 
components, and the potential losses from an incident.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-79">It is important to note that BIA is not designed 
specifically for a particular scenario. For example, you will not design
 the BIA to only work in a data breach scenario. It is not important 
what disrupted a Web application. The more important factor is 
identifying the critical processes, such as the Web application, and 
ensure that it continues to run no matter what type of disaster takes 
place.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-80"><b><i>Responsibility</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-81">In most cases, it is the responsibility of the 
Business Continuity Manager (BCM) to perform the BIA task. The Business 
Continuity Manager is the person who takes care of the business 
continuity tasks and, therefore, is considered to be the best person to 
handle the BIA task.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-82">However, there may be a situation when there is no 
business continuity team in an organization. In that situation, this 
task may be outsourced to an external entity, such as a well-qualified 
vendor. When you are outsourcing the BIA task to an external vendor, you
 need to ensure that the vendor has extensive experience in handling 
such tasks.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-83"><b><i>Participants in BIA</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-84">In most cases, BIA can be performed at different levels within an organization. You can perform the BIA task with:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-85">

<li id="cn-m28-85">Only critical departments and their functions</li>

<li id="cn-m28-86">Most of the departments and their functions</li>

<li id="cn-m28-87">All departments and their functions within the organization</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m28-88">After you have decided on the departments and 
functions, you need to start the BIA task by asking the questions. The 
questions can be divided into two parts:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-89">

<li id="cn-m28-89"><b>Monetary impact</b>: can include loss of revenue, cost of lawsuits and penalties, and increase operating costs, loss of sales, and increased income</li>

<li id="cn-m28-90"><b>Non-monetary impact</b>: can include loss of reputation, customer service, and operations, customer dissatisfaction</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m28-91">You can spend a few hours with each of the departments
 and ask them to complete these questions. On average, you should be 
spending 3-4 hours with each department. The answers can be put on a 
scale of 1 to 5.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-92"><b><i>Regulations and Standards</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-93">There are specific regulations and standards available
 the cover the financial and non-financial impact of the disruptions or 
disaster that may occur. These regulations and standards also cover the 
identification of resources and if they have any kinds of dependencies.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-94">Some of the key regulations and standards are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-95">

<li id="cn-m28-95">International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 22301</li>

<li id="cn-m28-96">National Fire Protection Act 1600</li>

<li id="cn-m28-97">Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s (FFIEC) BCP standard</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m28-98"><b><i>Challenges</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-99">When performing the BIA task, there is a high 
probability that you are likely to face several challenges. These 
challenges can be:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-100">

<li id="cn-m28-100"><b>Lack of involvement: </b>This is one of the 
biggest challenges in the BIA task. The employees within the 
organization do not dedicate time to this particular task. One of the 
key reasons is that the employees do not see a value in this particular 
task.</li>

<li id="cn-m28-101"><b>Correct selection of representatives</b>: When 
conducting the BIA task, you need to ensure that you spend time with the
 correct representatives. If you meet representatives, who do not have 
adequate knowledge about their business function, you will have 
incomplete answers for the BIA task.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m28-102"><b><i>BIA Process</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-103">The BIA processes focus on two types of impact:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-104">

<li id="cn-m28-104"><b>Financial</b>: focuses on the monetary losses, which can be the loss of sales and revenue.</li>

<li id="cn-m28-105"><b>Operational</b>: focuses on the loss of customers, poor customer services, and loss of reputation</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m28-106">To minimize the impact on financial and operational 
aspects, you need to develop the BIA process, which includes the 
following steps:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-107">

<li id="cn-m28-107">Define BIA boundaries</li>

<li id="cn-m28-108">Identify activities for products and services</li>

<li id="cn-m28-109">Assess financial and operational impact on products and services</li>

<li id="cn-m28-110">Identify critical functions and process</li>

<li id="cn-m28-111">Prioritize critical functions and processes</li>

<li id="cn-m28-112">Estimate the resources required for business continuity</li>

<li id="cn-m28-113">Determine the RTOs for critical functions and process</li>

<li id="cn-m28-114">Identify dependencies for functions and processes</li>

<li id="cn-m28-115">Determine RPOs for critical functions and services</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m28-121">Software can be equipped with different types of 
errors, which are known as defects. Some of the common types of defects 
that can exist within the software are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-122">

<li id="cn-m28-122">Functional</li>

<li id="cn-m28-123">Compilation</li>

<li id="cn-m28-124">Run time</li>

<li id="cn-m28-125">Logical errors</li>

<li id="cn-m28-126">Inappropriate error handling</li>

<li id="cn-m28-127">Calculation</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m28-128">It is important to note that in the software 
development lifecycle, the testing occurs quite late. Therefore, if any 
of the defects are present in the software, they can either be caught 
late in the lifecycle, or there can be a possibility that the defects 
slip through the testing process.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-129">Software assurance is the process in which you can 
ensure that the software functions as it is supposed to and is free from
 any kind of defects. Software assurance is more focused on developing 
software that is free from any kind of vulnerabilities and defects that 
are security-related.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-130">The software assurance process is built into the 
software development lifecycle, which integrates the methods of 
preventing, responding, mitigating, and remediating the defects 
throughout the lifecycle. For example, in the given exhibit, you can 
integrate a security-focused code review along with the code review. In 
the initial phases of the project, you can integrate secure and hardened
 environments.</p>

that can exist within software are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-138">

integrate a security-focused code review along with the code review. In 
the initial phases of the project, you can integrate secure and hardened
 environments.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-147"><b><i>Web Application Assurance</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-148">The majority of the users on the Internet connect to 
one or other Web applications, which are used for various purposes, such
 as online banking, shopping, car rental, and so on. However, it is 
important to ponder what happens when Web applications are not secure. 
Web applications can be hacked. Such hacking incidents take place 
because there are bugs or defects within the Web applications. The 
hackers tend to find such errors and exploit them for their gains.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-149">When an attack on a Web application takes place, it 
either loses the data or stops functioning. The outcome of the Web 
application depends on the type of hack that has been conducted. For 
example, a hacker may simply walk away with the data without causing any
 functionality issues. On the other hand, a hacker may simply gain 
control of the entire application and its administrative privileges.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-150"><b><i>Software Assurance Risks</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-151">When developing software, different types of risks 
must be thought through. The risks can be categorized into three 
different categories:</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-152"><b><i>Design Errors</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-153">It is often said that no software can be bug-free, 
and it is true because, intentionally or unintentionally, the software 
developers will leave defects within the software. These defects are 
later then exploited by malicious entities, such as hackers. The attack 
on the software can be in the form of malware, vulnerability 
exploitation, or even through zero-day vulnerability discoveries and 
exploitation.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-154">One method to prevent design errors is to use the best practices for secure software development and using the tools.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-155"><b><i>Ever Changing Technological Environment</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-156">The technological landscape is changing daily. With 
the use of new technology, there is always a risk of introducing new 
errors because the software developers are not skilled enough to handle 
these errors. The hackers, on the other hand, are one step ahead in not 
only their technology awareness but also in developing innovative 
methods to find bugs and defects with the developed software.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-157"><b><i>Malicious Insiders</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-158">More than the security or any other kind of defects, 
finding malicious insiders is a more difficult task. During the 
development process, you need to safeguard the code being developed. It 
must be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is not developed with a 
backdoor or any other security loophole. Best practices should be 
applied when hiring developers. The organization must ensure a thorough 
and strict background check.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-159"><b><i>Software Assurance Tools</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-160">As part of the software assurance process, you would 
need to perform several tests on the software being developed. There are
 several software assurance tools that you can use to ensure a secure 
software product. Some of the key software assurance tools that you can 
use are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-161">

<li id="cn-m28-161"><b>FindBugs</b>: Used for static analysis of Java code</li>

<li id="cn-m28-162"><b>Peach</b>: Is a fuzzing tool that can generate artificial input into a developed software</li>

<li id="cn-m28-163"><b>SonarQube</b>: Is an open-source tool for performing a static code analysis with several pre-defined rules</li>

<li id="cn-m28-164"><b>Yet Another Source Code Analyzer (YASCA</b>): Is 
an open-source tool that can test software for vulnerabilities and code 
quality. It can also be used for performance testing and adherence to 
best practices.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m28-165"><b><i>Software Assurance Maturity Model </i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-166">The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an 
opensource framework that can be tailed by the organization to manage 
risks. Some of the key components of SAMM are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-167">

<li id="cn-m28-167">Evaluate the software security practices within an organization</li>

<li id="cn-m28-168">Build a software security program</li>

<li id="cn-m28-169">Demonstrate improvements to an existing security assurance program</li>

<li id="cn-m28-170">Define and measure security-related activities that exist in an organization</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m28-171">SAMM can be applied and implemented with an 
organization of any size. It can also be applied to the entire 
organization or even a single project.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-172"><b><i>SAMM Architecture</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-173"><b>SAMM </b>defines four critical functions that span
 throughout the entire software development lifecycle. Each function has
 three security practices that must be followed.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-174"><b><i>Mobile Software Assurance</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-175">Just like a typical application or software, software
 assurance is also critical when you are developing a mobile app. When 
performing software assurance with the mobile app, you need to ensure 
the following:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-176">

<li id="cn-m28-176">Set up appropriate process</li>

<li id="cn-m28-177">Standardize the quality process to prevent errors</li>

<li id="cn-m28-178">Educate the users on the standardized process</li>

<li id="cn-m28-179">Focus on preventing the errors rather than fixing them</li>

<li id="cn-m28-180">Focus on fixing the errors during the development process</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m28-181">When developing a mobile app, you need to ensure that
 software assurance is enforced right from the beginning. It should not 
be enforced in the pre-release or post-release stage, which will detect 
bugs in the developed mobile app. You need to ensure that the software 
assurance processes are applied even if the app development is being 
done by the most experienced professionals in your organization.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-182"><b><i>Quality Issues in Mobile Apps</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-183">Just like a normal application or software, mobile 
apps can also have various types of bugs or issues. Some of the 
broad-level issues are categorized as follows:</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-184"><b><i>Functionality</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-185">The functionality issues related to the functions that do not work as required. Some of the examples can be:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-186">

<li id="cn-m28-186">App installation</li>

<li id="cn-m28-187">Login</li>

<li id="cn-m28-188">A specific feature not working</li>

<li id="cn-m28-189">Unnecessary errors generation</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m28-190"><b><i>Usability</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-191">Be it a software or a mobile app; usability is one of
 the biggest factors in its success. You would often find that a simple 
application has a cluttered or confusing interface. If this happens with
 your app, you can be assured that the users are likely to delete your 
app. You must ensure that the app interface has been designed and 
approved by a usability expert who has accounted for the best practices 
within the app.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-192"><b><i>Performance</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-193">There can be performance issues related to the 
functioning of the app. This could be related to the deteriorated 
performance of the app, which means that the app is unable to work with 
certain mobile devices because of resource issues. Another issue can be 
due to concurrent users using the app, which in the backend, connects to
 a server. A high number of concurrent users affect the server 
performance, and therefore, the app itself is affected.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-194"><b><i>Security</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-195">Security issues are one of the prime concerns with 
the mobile app. The confidentiality, integrity, and privacy of data 
becomes a concern when a strong encryption method is not used. Poor 
authentication and authorization methods also cause concerns.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-196">Another key issue related to security is the storage 
of data on the mobile device. Many app developers do not apply 
encryption to the stored data, which means that the data can be read 
without any specific tool. Along with the storage, the developers often 
do not use appropriately designed Web services to interact with the 
backend server, which may lead to the interception of data.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-197"><b><i>Basic Principles of Software Assurance</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-198">A few basic principles of software assurance are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-199">

<li id="cn-m28-199">Focus on preventing errors rather than fixing them</li>

<li id="cn-m28-200">Should be built into the app development process, which is every stage of the development</li>

<li id="cn-m28-201">Should focus on training the users, setting quality standards, and using the appropriate tools</li>

<li id="cn-m28-202">Should use the Fit for purpose and right first time</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m28-203">The app development process can further have better 
quality results by using the Continuous Integration method, which 
requires the developers to check-in the code into a shared repository. 
The code check-in can be done various times a day. As and when the code 
is checked-in, an automated test can be run to detect defects. With this
 method, the defects are easily detected quite early in the development 
process rather than waiting for the testing or pre-release phase.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-204"><b><i>Software Assurance Best Practices</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-205">When developing a mobile app, you should apply the 
software assurance best practices. Some of the key mobile app software 
assurance best practices are:</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-206"><b><i>Use Multiple Types of Tests</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-207">A mobile app’s quality cannot be assured with one or 
two types of tests. Rather, a series of tests must be executed to ensure
 that all aspects of quality, such as functionality, performance, and 
security, is assured.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-208">You can execute some of the key tests, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-209">

<li id="cn-m28-209">Load</li>

<li id="cn-m28-210">Functional</li>

<li id="cn-m28-211">Accessibility</li>

<li id="cn-m28-212">Security</li>

<li id="cn-m28-213">Performance</li>

<li id="cn-m28-214">Graphical User Interface (GUI)</li>

<li id="cn-m28-215">Integration</li>

<li id="cn-m28-216">System</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m28-217"><b><i>Test With Different Devices</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-218">It is quite obvious that the app will run across 
various devices with different hardware and operating systems, such as 
iOS and Android. Before launching an app with users, you should ensure 
that the app has been tested with a variety of hardware and operating 
systems. For example, you may test with various versions of Android and 
iOS.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-219">Arranging for a variety of devices with different 
operating systems can be a major bottleneck. To resolve this issue, you 
can use emulators, which can be used for testing purposes.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-220"><b><i>Watch for Resource Utilization</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-221">Before you launch the app with the end-users, you 
must test the app for resource utilization. You can check for memory and
 CPU utilization. Along with this, you must also test for battery usage.
 Your app should not be draining the battery of a mobile device.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-222"><b><i>Perform Stress Level Tests</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-223">You should test the app under stressed out 
conditions, specifically when the CPU and memory utilization is high. 
You should test how the app behaves, and its performance metrics should 
be captured.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-224"><b><i>Feed Sample Data</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-225">During the beta phase, you should feed in the sample 
data and notice the results. You should attempt searching, adding, 
modifying, and deleting the data. In this practice, you are likely to 
discover that there are issues in data handling.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-226"><b><i>Software Assessment Methods</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-227">Load testing is performed to determine a system's 
behavior under both normal and anticipated peak load conditions. It 
helps to identify the maximum operating capacity of an application as 
well as any bottlenecks and determine which element is causing 
degradation.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-228">Vulnerability assessment helps you locate the vulnerabilities in an application.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-229">User Acceptance Test is a beta test, which typically 
involves the real application users. Fuzz testing helps you discover the
 security loopholes and coding errors.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-230">The regression testing ensures that if the code has 
been modified or something has been added or removed from the 
application, there are no side effects.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-231">A regression test tests the code after it has been 
changed. Its intent to trace the defects that may have occurred due to 
code changes. In peer review, two developers review each other’s code.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-234">A hardware root of trust serves as the foundation to secure operations of a system. It serves two key functions:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-235">

<li id="cn-m28-235">store encryption keys that are used in the cryptographic functions</li>

<li id="cn-m28-236">enable a secure boot process</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m28-237">The root of trust is implemented in the hardware and,
 therefore, cannot be tampered with. In a normal scenario, a system is 
prone to malware and other types of attacks, and if the encryption keys 
are stored in the system, they can be easily stolen. However, the root 
of trust is immune to a malware attack.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-238">The root of trust can be implemented in two different ways. It can be either:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-239">

<li id="cn-m28-239">a stand-alone security module</li>

<li id="cn-m28-240">security module that can be embedded within a processor or system on chip (SoC)</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m28-241">There are two types of hardware root of trust:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-242">

<li id="cn-m28-242"><b>Fixed function</b>: designed to perform a 
specific function, such as data encryption. Other functions it can 
perform is key management and certificate validation. However, other 
than the defined functions, it cannot perform any other functions.</li>

<li id="cn-m28-243"><b>Programmable</b>: is designed to perform complex tasks and functions. It is possible to upgrade a programmable root of trust.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m28-244">A root of trust can be applied using:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-245">

<li id="cn-m28-245">A private cryptographic key</li>

<li id="cn-m28-246">Physically Unclonable Function (PUF)</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m28-247">With the root of trust enforced, the booting process 
of a system is considered to be genuine, with any applications running 
on it.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-248">In this exercise, you will learn about the Hardware Security Module and the Trusted Platform Module.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m28-250">After completing this exercise, you will have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-251">

<li id="cn-m28-251">Hardware Assurances</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Devices</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m28-253">This exercise contains supporting materials for CySA+.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-254"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m28-c-4" src="ApplyingSecurityConceptstoMitigateRisk_files/image-m28-c-4.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m28-255"><b>Hardware Security Module (HSM)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m28-256">A&nbsp;hardware security module&nbsp;(HSM) is a 
security device that is used for safeguarding and managing digital keys,
 which are used for strong authentication. HSM can be in the form of a 
plug-in card or an external device.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-257">Following are the functions of an HSM:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-258">

<li id="cn-m28-258">Performing encryption and decryption</li>

<li id="cn-m28-259">Manage secure key generation</li>

<li id="cn-m28-260">Perform secure key storage</li>

<li id="cn-m28-261">Manage Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) keys for databases</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m28-262">The following cryptographic algorithms are supported with microSD HSM:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-263">

<li id="cn-m28-263">AES</li>

<li id="cn-m28-264">RSA</li>

<li id="cn-m28-265">SHA-1</li>

<li id="cn-m28-266">Triple DES</li>

<li id="cn-m28-267">Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m28-268">Other than these cryptographic algorithms, SHA-256 is also supported by HSM.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-269">Let’s take the example of a Webserver that you have. 
The Web server is configured to run a Website with a certificate. You 
notice that after the certificate configuration, the Web server has 
slowed down. You want the Web server to give good performance while 
using the certificate, and at the same time, you also want to protect 
its private key.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-270">HSM can meet both the requirements mentioned in the 
scenario. HSM increases the performance of the Web server by offloading 
the cryptographic functions. Moreover, HSM stores the private key. There
 are different varieties available, such as USB and PCIe cards.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-271"><b><i>HSM Functions</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-272">HSM can perform various functions, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-273">

<li id="cn-m28-273">encryption keys management</li>

<li id="cn-m28-274">key exchange</li>

<li id="cn-m28-275">encryption and decryption</li>

<li id="cn-m28-276">cryptographic functions offloading from servers</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m28-277">HSM can be embedded in different types of hardware. Some of the key examples are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-278">

<li id="cn-m28-278">FIPS 140-3 compliant rack-mount chassis</li>

<li id="cn-m28-279">PCI-E cards</li>

<li id="cn-m28-280">USB drives</li>

<li id="cn-m28-281">MicroSD cards</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m28-282"><b><i>Types of HSM</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-283">There are typically three types of HSM:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-284">

<li id="cn-m28-284"><b>Hardware</b>: are available in the form of a device, such as PCI-E cards or MicroSD cards</li>

<li id="cn-m28-285"><b>Virtual</b>: is known as the virtual key manager,
 which can be downloaded from a software vendor’s Website. They can be 
FIPS 140-2 compliant, but not validated as there is no physical hardware
 involved.</li>

<li id="cn-m28-286"><b>Hosted</b>: are available in the cloud 
environment. They perform the same functions to generate and protect 
keys. It provides the same level of security in the cloud environment as
 a hardware HSM in the local environment.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m28-287"><b>Trusted Platform Module (TPM)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m28-288">Motherboards of the modern systems include a chip 
that is known as a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which provides a 
hardware root of trust for secure computing. When a system has TPM, you 
can configure it by accessing BIOS within the system. A TPM can perform 
various functions, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-289">

<li id="cn-m28-289">Storage of encryption keys</li>

<li id="cn-m28-290">Management of encryption keys</li>

<li id="cn-m28-291">Perform encryption and decryption process</li>

<li id="cn-m28-292">Storage of certificates</li>

<li id="cn-m28-293">Storage of passwords</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m28-294">You can configure TPM to perform full disk encryption
 (FDE). However, for TPM to perform FDE, you need to ensure TPM, after 
which it becomes the root of trust. Once it becomes the root of trust, 
the hard drive is locked with the encryption keys, which means that it 
cannot be simply taken out and plugged into another system for data 
retrieval. When you enable TPM in a system, it performs a complete 
system check and verifies the systems’ integrity. Further, it ensures 
the integrity of the entire boot process within a system.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-295">The concept of the root of trust is formed by the use
 of TPM, which ensures that the hardware cannot be either tampered with 
or replicated. For example, someone cannot just copy a particular 
motherboard to break the encryption applied through TPM.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-296">It is important to note that TPM must be configured 
without which it is of no use. You must configure and lock TPM to ensure
 that its configuration, including the access policies, cannot be 
altered. With the locking method, the configured security profiles 
cannot be changed, leading to a high level of security for the system.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-297"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m28-c-5" src="ApplyingSecurityConceptstoMitigateRisk_files/image-m28-c-5.jpg" alt="This image is described in the fig caption that follows this image."><figcaption>Figure
 1.1 Diagram showing the Chain of Trust. It shows a Hardware Security 
Device &gt; SecureBoot Code &gt; Integrity Check (Public Keys) &gt; 
Validating System Images (Kernal and Libraries &gt; Authorizing 
Applications.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m28-298">Using the TPM, SecureBoot ensures only the trusted 
operating system bootloaders can load in the system. For the Secureboot 
to work, you need to have two components in the system:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-299">

<li id="cn-m28-299">UEFI firmware</li>

<li id="cn-m28-300">TPM</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m28-301"><b><i>Functioning of TPM</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-302">A TPM works in two different ways:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-303">

<li id="cn-m28-303"><b>Pre-boot</b>: Secures the boot process to ensure its integrity by scanning the BIOS for any unauthorized changes</li>

<li id="cn-m28-304"><b>Post-boot</b>: Can be configured as the root of trust for authentication and enable encryption for data protection</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m28-305">TPM becomes handy when you are looking for 
unbreakable security. This is because TPM is a hardware-based security 
solution that cannot be altered or tampered with. In a comparison of 
software-level security, TPM can provide protection from hackers and any
 kind of malicious software, such as malware.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-306"><b><i>Typical Use Cases of TPM</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-307">If you are using the latest version of Windows, such as <b>Windows 10</b>, you would have used <b>BitLocker </b>to
 encrypt the hard drive. BitLocker can work with TPM as well, and half 
of the encryption key of BitLocker is stored in TPM, and the other half 
is stored on the hard drive. When you boot the system, TPM runs a series
 of tests to ensure secure boot up. However, with the BitLocker enabled,
 if you move the hard drive to another system, then the hard drive is 
locked. For the system to boot properly, it needs to have access to both
 parts of the hard drive.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-308"><b><i>Verifying the TPM Chip</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-309">Microsoft provides a method to check if your system has a <b>TPM </b>chip on the motherboard. You need to simply run the tpm.msc tool on the Windows system, which could be running <b>Windows 7</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>8</b>,<b>1</b>, or <b>10</b>.</p>

<p id="cn-m28-310">When you run the <b>tpm.msc tool</b>, you get the following console:</p>

<p id="cn-m28-311"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m28-c-6" src="ApplyingSecurityConceptstoMitigateRisk_files/image-m28-c-6.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 Screenshot of the TPM Management window dashboard."><figcaption>Figure 3.2 Screenshot of the TPM Management window dashboard.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m28-312">There can be a possibility that your system has the 
TPM chip, but it is disabled in BIOS. In that case, the TPM chip will 
not appear in Windows. To enable the TPM chip, you need to get into the 
BIOS, for which the process may differ from system to system. Once you 
get into the BIOS (or UEFI), you can enable the TPM chip.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m28-313"><b><i>TPM vs. HSM</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m28-314">There can be confusion about the functioning of TPM 
and HSM. However, both of them have quite a few differences. Here are 
some of the key differences:</p>

<ul id="cn-m28-315">

<li id="cn-m28-315"><b>Hardware: </b>A TPM chip is embedded on a motherboard in most cases. HSM, on the other hand, is typically removable or are external devices.</li>

<li id="cn-m28-316"><b>Uses: </b>A TPM is used for full disk encryption,
 such as used with BitLocker for full disk encryption. On the other 
hand, HSM is used primarily for mission-critical servers, which could be
 SSL accelerators or certificate authorities.</li>

<li id="cn-m28-317"><b>Authentication: </b>A TPM is used for platform authentication. On the other hand, HSM is mainly used for authentication of authorized applications.</li>

<li id="cn-m28-318"><b>Encryption Keys: </b>A TPM stores the RSA key 
within its chip. It can also generate other keys. On the other hand, HSM
 also stores the RSA keys, but to be used in asymmetric encryption. 
Similar to a TPM, it can generate encryption keys.</li>
