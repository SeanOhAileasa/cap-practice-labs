<p id="cn-m23-72">After the threat has been isolated or contained, the 
next steps are to eradicate the threat. Several tasks can be performed 
to eradicate the threat(s). Not all tasks need to be performed at once. 
Depending on the nature of the incident, one or more methods may be 
used.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-87"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m23-c-1" src="LaterPhasesofIncidentResponse_files/image-m23-c-1.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-88"><b>Vulnerability Mitigation</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-89">Attackers always look for vulnerabilities that they 
can exploit. After an incident, it needs to be ensured that the 
vulnerabilities are closed. They need to be patched with the required 
patches and updates.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-90">If an organization does not have a vulnerability 
mitigation process in place, then it should develop one, after a threat 
has been isolated or contained. The vulnerability mitigation method may 
consist of one or more methods for handling vulnerabilities. For 
example, one method can be patch management. The second method can be a 
workaround in case an update or patch is not available for a specific 
vulnerability. Hardening, for example, can be an alternate measure.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-91">Vulnerability mitigation should be monitored 
continuously. As and when new vulnerabilities are discovered, they 
should be patched appropriately. The time frame for patching the 
vulnerabilities depends on their criticality.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-93"><b>Sanitization</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-94">Sanitization refers to freeing a hard drive from any 
kind of threat. The sanitization method differs between a hard drive and
 solid-state drives. The hard drive, which is also known as a mechanical
 hard drive, can be overwritten multiple times. When a hard drive is 
overwritten multiple times, data that was present earlier in the hard 
drive cannot be recovered.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-95">The data overwriting method does not work well with 
solid-state drives, which requires data to be securely erased. A 
third-party or manufacturer-provided utility can be used to erase data.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-96">Multiple methods can be used in sanitization:</p>

<p id="cn-m23-97"><b>Degaussing</b>: The degaussing method uses an 
electromagnet to wipe data and make the media useless. This makes it 
impossible to recover any data. This is a method of physical 
destruction.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-98"><b>Low-level Format</b>: The low-level format works 
slightly differently than a high-level format. It erases a disk entirely
 and removes everything from the hard drive, including the sector 
address table. It is virtually impossible to recover data from a low 
level formatted hard drive. Once a low-level format is complete, the 
hard drive is fresh for use.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-99"><b>Data Disposal</b>: In the data disposal method, you
 eliminate data stored on the hard drive in a manner that makes it 
unreadable. Even with the use of a specialized tool, data cannot be 
recovered.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-100"><b>Data Overwrite</b>: Data overwriting is simply 
deleting the old data and adding new data on the hard drive. The new 
data keeps overwriting locations from where the old data has been 
deleted.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-101"><b>Data Wipe</b>: Data wipe overwrites the hard drive with 0 and 1 and ensures that the data cannot be recovered.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-102"><b>Cryptographic Erase</b>: Cryptographic erase (CE) 
is a method of eliminating the key pair or even the public key. The data
 is useless on the hard drive after the key pair is eliminated. This 
method, unlike the other mentioned methods, does not damage the drive or
 its media, and drive can be further formatted and used.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-103"><b>Reconstruction/Reimaging</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-104">After a system has been sanitized, which means that 
threat has been completely removed from the system, it must be re-used, 
which can be done by rebuilding the system. To be able to do this, it 
needs to be installed with an operating system, applications, and data 
that should be added. If this system is a special-purpose system, such 
as a Webserver, it needs to be configured properly. All these tasks are 
performed manually, which can take a few hours to complete.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-105">A better approach is to use images, which are 
standardized and hardened. An organization can have images for desktops,
 workstations, laptops, and servers. If a system goes down or crashes, 
its relevant image can be deployed on the system to get it up and 
running in a matter of a few minutes.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-106">These images can be deployed manually or through an 
image deployment application, such as Windows Deployment Services (WDS).
 Using the manual method, you can deploy an image on one system at a 
time, which is still faster than manual installation and configuration. 
Using the automated method, you can simply deploy the image with a few 
clicks, and images can be deployed to several systems at once.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-107"><b>Secure Disposal</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-108">Hard drives do not last forever. After using a hard 
drive for a few years, there are chances that you will need to replace 
it with a new one. When you get the new hard drive, then you need to 
dispose of the old one. Before you discard the old hard drive, you need 
to ensure your method of disposal is secure. No one should be able to 
use the old hard drive and extract its data. Several sanitization 
methods can be used before securely disposing of the hard drive. Some of
 the key methods include clearing, purging, and destruction.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-109"><b>Patching</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-110">To prevent any kind of threat to the systems, its 
applications, and operating system, you need to ensure that the system 
is regularly patched. You have to pay attention to patching not only on 
the operating system and applications but also the firmware updates if 
they are available.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-111">In many cases, the network devices, such as routers 
and switches, keep running older versions of the software. They are not 
upgraded or patched. Attackers are always looking out for such devices 
or systems that are unpatched. Your organization must implement a patch 
management process, which not only focuses on the systems and servers 
but also on the network devices.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-112"><b>Restoration of Permissions</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-113">After a threat has been eradicated and the system has
 been restored to a working condition, you have to ensure that you 
verify the user permissions on the system. There may be local users 
created or directory accounts being used, in either case, the correct 
permissions must be applied.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-114">You may have to alter some of the permissions based 
on the outcome of the incident. For example, if there were multiple 
administrators on a server, you may want to restrict that to not more 
than two. No user should be given more permissions that the ones 
required to perform their job function.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-115">After the correct permissions have been finalized and
 if they differ from the older ones, you should get them approved from 
the change approval board and update the permissions in the 
configuration database.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-116"><b>Reconstitution of Resources</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-117">After an incident, there may be a need to 
reconstitute the resources that exist on the network. Reconstitution of 
resources is one of the recovery methods. The systems and the network 
devices may have to be realigned or reconfigured to ensure that the same
 incident does not repeat.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-118">Consider an example in which your organization uses a
 flat network. All systems and servers exist on a single network. After a
 breach incident, you start to reorganize the systems in different 
segments. The reconstitution of the resources must be put forward to the
 change approval board as a change. Once it is approved, then the 
reconstitution should take place.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-119"><b>Restoration of Capabilities and Services</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-120">It is quite possible that during an incident, several
 services and capabilities are impaired. Such an incident can bring the 
normal functioning of an organization to a halt. Therefore, as soon as 
the incident is over, you need to start restoring the capabilities and 
services to ensure the business can function normally. To be able to do 
this, you need to identify the actions and tasks that will help you 
perform restoration in the quickest way possible.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-121">The restoration of capabilities and services should 
be built into a plan, which should have been defined much earlier than 
the incident took place. This plan helps in quick restoration. If the 
plan does not work as expected in restoring the capabilities and 
services, then you need to ensure that it is updated and tested.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-122"><b>Verification of Logging/ Communication to Security Monitoring</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-123">Logs are generated on a device or a system. However, 
the logs must be maintained to review its state regularly. There can be 
incidents when the attacker erases the logs. To prevent this situation 
from occurring, you should either configure a syslog server or a 
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-124">Also, most systems and network devices start to 
collect events as soon as they are installed and configured. However, 
you need to ensure that the logs are not overwritten when they are full.
 Each log can be of a certain size within an application, operating 
system, or in a network device. You should check the possibility of 
generating new logs once a particular log is full.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-125">You may also have to preserve the logs. There can be 
various methods that can be used. You may have to preserve the logs 
manually. You may have to write a script to preserve them. Some 
applications allow you to preserve the logs automatically.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-126">You also have to ensure that the systems that are 
sending the logs to the syslog server or SIEM system have enough 
bandwidth and constant communication taking place between them. You can 
lose logs if there is a communication break between the system and the 
syslog server or SIEM system.</p>

<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m23-129"><b>Exercise 2 - Post-incident Activities</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m23-130">After an incident is over and has been closed 
successfully, several tasks need to be performed. These tasks are known 
as post-incident activities, which outline the entire incident. These 
activities also help you gain more insights into the improvement areas 
in the infrastructure.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-131">In this exercise, you will learn about the post-incident activities.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m23-147"><b>Evidence Retention</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-148">After an incident has been handled and closed, there 
are usually several pieces of evidence that have been gathered. 
Depending on the type of evidence gathered, the <b>Incident Response </b>(<b>IR</b>)
 team should decide the next course of action. For example, if there has
 been a massive data breach and the source of the breach is an external 
entity, then it would be good to inform the legal team to get in touch 
with the law authorities and inform them accordingly.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-149">Not all evidence needs to be produced to the law 
authorities. There may be evidence that requires the IR team to enforce 
the retention policies within the organization. The evidence must be 
retained for further analysis and future references. The evidence must 
be retained properly so that it does not lose its value. For example, if
 a system has been used in hacking, it must be taken as evidence 
following the digital forensics guidelines. The IR team needs to ensure 
that the system has been handled in a way that does not lose its memory 
and the data on the hard drive.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-150"><b>Lessons Learned Report</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-151">After the incident is over, the IR team needs to 
create the lessons learned report, which needs to detail out the 
incident. After the incident, a formal meeting should be held, which is 
the lesson learned review. As the output of this meeting, the lesson 
learned report should be generated.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-152">In the lesson learned review, a detailed discussion 
should be held focusing on the current incident. This meeting should be 
held by a facilitator who was not involved in the incident. It is more 
like an independent review to avoid any kind of biased opinion of the 
incident that took place. Everyone who was involved in the incident 
should be present in the review meeting, and there should be an open 
discussion focusing on the incident.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-153">During the review, several questions should be answered. Some of the key questions are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m23-154">

<li id="cn-m23-154">When did the incident take place?</li>

<li id="cn-m23-155">What happened during the incident?</li>

<li id="cn-m23-156">How did the IR team and management respond to the incident?</li>

<li id="cn-m23-157">Were there any documented procedures available to handle the incident. If yes, were the procedures followed?</li>

<li id="cn-m23-158">Were the documented procedures adequately documented to handle the incident?</li>

<li id="cn-m23-159">Is this a repeat incident that happened in the past as well?</li>

<li id="cn-m23-160">Was there any documentation available on any similar
 incident that happened in the past? If yes, was the documentation 
sufficient?</li>

<li id="cn-m23-161">What are the corrective actions that need to be implemented to prevent any future occurrence of a similar incident?</li>

<li id="cn-m23-162">How can a similar incident be protected in the future?</li>

<li id="cn-m23-163">What are the indicators for the occurrence of such as incident?</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m23-164">These are some of the key questions that need to be 
answered in the lesson learned review meeting. Each organization may 
tailor the questions depending on their needs. Once the answers are 
obtained, they need to be documented in the report along with the 
complete history of the incident. The follow-up actions should also be 
decided based on the answers from the review meeting.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-165"><b>Change Control Process</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-166">After the IR team has created the lesson learned 
report, there may be certain changes in the infrastructure that would be
 required. These changes would need to be built into the infrastructure 
to ensure that the same or similar incident does not take place. To be 
able to do this, a list of required changes need to be implemented. 
These changes will need to go through the change control process. The 
outcome of the submission to the change control board may be approved or
 disapproved of changes. Therefore, to ensure that the changes are 
approved, they should carry justifications and artifacts.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-167">After the changes are approved, they need to be 
implemented based on the defined timeline. One important point to note 
is that these are not regular changes that can be implemented over a 
longer period. The changes that are required to prevent an incident from
 occurring should be implemented as soon as possible.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-168">The changes that are rejected by the change control 
board should be reviewed once again and then again, either approved or 
rejected.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-169"><b>Incident Response Plan Update</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-170">If there was an incident plan and it did not work as 
expected, then it needs to be updated after the incident is over. The 
changes that have been approved by the change approved board must also 
be incorporated in the Incident Response Plan. The review meeting is 
likely to bring out several flaws that can exist in the Incident 
Response Plan, and therefore, based on the outcome of the review 
meeting, the Incident Response Plan should be updated.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-171">After the Incident Response Plan is updated, then it 
should be shared with the rest of the team. Sharing with the team 
ensures that everyone has the same version and has the same set of 
information from the Incident Response Plan.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-172"><b>Incident Summary Report</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-173">A summary of the incident must be documented. This 
document is typically known as the Incident Summary Report, which is 
written in simple plain English. Every stakeholder should receive one 
copy of this report and should go through it to understand what has 
happened in the incident. Since it is written in plain English, the 
report can be easily understood by the recipients. The report should 
define the incident in detail and how it was handled.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-174"><b>Indicator of Compromise (IOC) Generation</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-175">Indicator of Compromise or IoC is the evidence that 
indicates a security attack, incident, or breach that has taken place. 
With the help of IoC, the Incident Response team may detect an attack at
 the early stage. Some of the key examples of IoC are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m23-176">

<li id="cn-m23-176">Logs</li>

<li id="cn-m23-177">Metadata</li>

<li id="cn-m23-178">Corrupt system files</li>

<li id="cn-m23-179">Unusual inbound and outbound traffic</li>

<li id="cn-m23-180">Unknown files in the system</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m23-181">There can be various types of IoC, and it is not easy
 to detect them. Once an IoC is located, it is obvious that an attack is
 ongoing.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-183"><b>Monitoring</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-184">After everything regarding an incident is in place, 
you need to start monitoring the network, its systems and devices, and 
applications. You need to ensure that there is continuous monitoring to 
prevent an incident from occurring. It is a noted fact that if you 
perform continuous monitoring, you can either prevent or catch an attack
 at an early stage, which helps you limit the damage. If you are not 
monitoring your network, then you will never know what is going on.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-185">Monitoring can be of two types:</p>

<p id="cn-m23-186"><b>Active</b>: When performing active monitoring, you
 reach out to the systems that you want to monitor. For example, if you 
want to test whether a system is live on the network, then you can 
trigger a ping command to test the system availability.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-187"><b>Passive</b>: You capture the traffic that passes a
 specific location or from the network. For example, you can use 
Wireshark to capture the network traffic and find anomalies.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-188"><b>Task 1 - View a Sample Incident Response Report</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-189">An incident response report gives details about the 
incident that has occurred, the course of action that was taken during 
the incident response, and an analysis of the incident.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-190">In this task, you will view a sample incident response report from the lab.</p>

<span class="cn-quote" id="cn-m23-191"><b><i>Note: </i></b><i>This
