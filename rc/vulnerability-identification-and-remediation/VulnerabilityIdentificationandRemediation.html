<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m7-68"><b>Exercise 1 - Vulnerability Identification</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m7-69">Vulnerabilities can lead to a system compromise or even
 attack of several types of malware. You should ensure that you can 
close the vulnerabilities that exist within a system or even a network. 
However, before you close the vulnerabilities, you must be able to find 
them and identify them correctly.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-70">There will be instances when you will run a 
vulnerability scanner, but the identified vulnerabilities will not 
exist. You should be able to manually verify the vulnerabilities and 
ensure that the scanner results are inspected and reviewed closely.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-71">In this exercise, you will learn about vulnerabilities identification.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m7-73">After completing this exercise, you will have a further understanding of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-74">

<li id="cn-m7-74">Asset Criticality</li>

<li id="cn-m7-75">Active vs. Passive Scanning</li>

<li id="cn-m7-76">Mapping/Enumeration</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Devices</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m7-78">This exercise contains supporting materials for CySA+.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-79"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m7-c-1" src="VulnerabilityIdentificationandRemediation_files/image-m7-c-1.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-80"><b>Asset Criticality</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-81">An asset for an organization is something that has a 
value, which depends on the type of asset. There can be an asset, which 
can have a little value, and then there can also be an asset that has 
high value. For example, a chair and a database both are assets for the 
organization. However, a chair will have little value as compared to a 
database, which holds hundreds of Gigabytes of customer information.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-82">The assets can be broadly categorized as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-83">

<li id="cn-m7-83"><b>Information Assets</b>: An organization can 
collect, categorize, and store information in different ways. For 
example, information can be stored within databases and files.</li>

<li id="cn-m7-84"><b>Software Assets</b>: Software is defined as a piece
 of code that is written to achieve a specific output. For example, 
Microsoft Word is also a piece of code that is meant to create and 
modify documents. An organization can have different types of software 
assets, such as application and system software.</li>

<li id="cn-m7-85"><b>Physical Assets</b>: No organization can run 
without physical assets. These are in different shapes and forms, and 
the nature of each physical asset may differ. You could have computers, 
communication equipment, storage devices, electrical devices, furniture,
 and even the facility or the building as a physical asset.</li>

<li id="cn-m7-86"><b>Service Assets</b>: There will be different forms 
of services that would be running within the organization. An example of
 service can be communication services, such as voice communication or 
the telephone. Internet services being used by the organization is 
another form of service. There can also be computing services, which can
 either be developed in-house or outsourced from a third-party.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m7-88"><b><i>Asset Inventories</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m7-89">In an organization, assets can be collected and 
organized in asset inventories, which are created as part of the Asset 
Management process. Each asset within the inventory will have a value, 
which can either be low or high, depending on its criticality. Each 
asset within the asset inventory has a cost attached, which is 
calculated using the Risk Management process.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-90">With the help of asset inventories, an organization can
 track its assets, including the assets that are high value. You can 
also identify the importance of an asset using the inventory.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-91">With the use of asset inventory, you can track important details about the assets:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-92">

<li id="cn-m7-92">Identification</li>

<li id="cn-m7-93">Acquisition date</li>

<li id="cn-m7-94">Security classification</li>

<li id="cn-m7-95">The location where the asset is placed</li>

<li id="cn-m7-96">Back and restore (if in the form of data or information)</li>

<li id="cn-m7-97">Owner or custodian</li>

<li id="cn-m7-98">Criticality level</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m7-99">With the help of the criticality level of the asset, 
you can put in proper measures for its protection. For example, if it is
 a server holding critical business data, you would want to not only put
 in enough security controls, but you would also want to plan for its 
maintenance and that there is a backup and restore process that is put 
in place.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-100">Asset inventories must be reviewed periodically. This 
is important because the criticality of the asset can change over a 
period. It could also be possible that new assets are added to the asset
 inventory. However, without the periodic review, you may not be able to
 assign the correct level of criticality to these assets.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-101">Most importantly, the criticality of an asset is 
directly relative to the high-cost risk that may arise if the asset 
fails. If it is an asset that has high value for the organization, then 
its criticality needs to be higher.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-102"><b>Active vs. Passive Scanning</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-103">Active scanning is a critical task that must be 
performed when measuring the security of systems within a network. 
During active scanning, you need to send traffic to the systems on the 
network and gather various types of information, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-104">

<li id="cn-m7-104">Device names</li>

<li id="cn-m7-105">IP addresses</li>

<li id="cn-m7-106">Installed software</li>

<li id="cn-m7-107">Firmware versions</li>

<li id="cn-m7-108">Patches</li>

<li id="cn-m7-109">Operating system versions</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m7-110">In the active scanning, broadcast traffic is sent to 
the target systems, and then the information is collected. However, 
active scans can be detected by the target systems. If there are too 
many requested being sent in active scanning, these requests can also 
cause performance issues with the target systems.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-111">Passive scanning, on the other hand, does not send 
direct traffic to the target systems. Rather, it analyses the network 
traffic and then identifies the targets. As compared to the active 
monitoring, there is no additional traffic generated in passive 
scanning, and therefore, the target systems do not suffer from 
performance issues.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-112">On the other hand, passive scanning is dependent on 
the type of network traffic that is generated. If a few systems on the 
network do not generate any kind of traffic, then they are not included 
in the network traffic and, therefore, cannot be scanned in the passive 
scanning.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-113"><b>Enumeration</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-114">Enumeration allows you to establish an active 
connection with a target. Your intent is to extract different types of 
information from the target. Some of the information that you can 
extract is:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-115">

<li id="cn-m7-115">Usernames</li>

<li id="cn-m7-116">Group names</li>

<li id="cn-m7-117">Hostnames</li>

<li id="cn-m7-118">Network shares and services</li>

<li id="cn-m7-119">Routing tables</li>

<li id="cn-m7-120">Web application</li>

<li id="cn-m7-121">Web servers</li>

<li id="cn-m7-122">SNMP information</li>

<li id="cn-m7-123">DNS information</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m7-124">Various types of enumerations can be performed. Some of these are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-125">

<li id="cn-m7-125">Windows Enumeration</li>

<li id="cn-m7-126">Linux Enumeration</li>

<li id="cn-m7-127">NetBIOS Enumeration</li>

<li id="cn-m7-128">SNMP Enumeration</li>

<li id="cn-m7-129">LDAP Enumeration</li>

<li id="cn-m7-130">NTP Enumeration</li>

<li id="cn-m7-131">SMTP Enumeration</li>

<li id="cn-m7-132">DNS Enumeration</li>

<h2>CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+) Practice Labs</h2>
<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m7-134"><b>Exercise 2 - Validation</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m7-135">A vulnerability scanner will run through the 
designated environment and try to locate open ports, running servers, 
and vulnerabilities within the applications or the operating systems. 
Vulnerability scanners have tests that are pre-defined or can be defined
 based on which the vulnerabilities are detected.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-136">However, the vulnerability scanner may provide 
accurate or inaccurate results. It might detect a vulnerability that is 
not one and may even miss a vulnerability even though it does exist 
within the system or the application.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-137">It is important to note that once the vulnerabilities 
are discovered, they should also be verified and investigated for 
further actions.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-138">In this exercise, you will learn about the types of vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m7-140">After completing this exercise, you will have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-141">

<li id="cn-m7-141">True Positives</li>

<li id="cn-m7-142">False Positives</li>

<li id="cn-m7-143">True Negatives</li>

<li id="cn-m7-144">False Negatives</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Devices</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m7-146">This exercise contains supporting materials for CySA+.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-147"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m7-c-2" src="VulnerabilityIdentificationandRemediation_files/image-m7-c-2.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-148"><b>True Positive</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-149">When a vulnerability scanner runs, it identifies a 
vulnerability. After verification and further investigation, you 
discover that it is a legitimate vulnerability that has been located. 
Once you verify the vulnerability, you must close it depending on its 
criticality and severity.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-150"><b>False Positive</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-151">There will be instances in which you run the 
vulnerability scanner, which generates a list of several 
vulnerabilities. After you investigate, you find out that a few of the 
vulnerabilities do not exist. For example, a vulnerability might be 
related to a missing patch. When you investigate, you find that the 
missing patch is not required because its related application does not 
exist on the system.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-152"><b>True Negative</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-153">The vulnerability scanner does not identify a 
vulnerability within the system or application, and in reality, there is
 not a vulnerability. For example, the vulnerability scanner has not 
identified a single vulnerability. After manual verification and 
investigation, you also are not able to identify a vulnerability. In 
both cases, the result is shown as a health system and application.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-154"><b>False Negative</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-155">Consider a scenario in which you run a vulnerability 
scanner, and it may only list a few vulnerabilities within the system. 
Then, you test the operating system and applications with a second 
vulnerability scanner and find that there are several new 
vulnerabilities, which were missed by the first vulnerability scanner. 
Missed vulnerabilities can be considered False Negatives. These are 
vulnerabilities that do exist within the system or applications, but 
they have been missed by the vulnerability scanner.</p>

<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m7-158"><b>Exercise 3 - Remediation / Mitigation</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m7-159">Over the last few years, cloud computing has become 
increasingly popular. Many organizations have moved from on-premises 
infrastructure to cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-160">Just like local infrastructure, cloud infrastructure has its own set of vulnerabilities and potential threats.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-161">In this exercise, you will learn about the types of cloud deployment models and their vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m7-163">After completing this exercise, you have further knowledge of:</p>

<li id="cn-m7-165">Hardening</li>

<li id="cn-m7-166">Compensating Controls</li>

<li id="cn-m7-167">Risk Acceptance</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Devices</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m7-169">This exercise contains supporting materials for CySA+.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-170"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m7-c-3" src="VulnerabilityIdentificationandRemediation_files/image-m7-c-3.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-171"><b>Configuration Baselines</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-172">When configuring a system, you can configure it with 
specific settings according to the machine’s role on the network. Based 
on the role, certain features or applications may not be required. You 
will turn off the specific services on the system and configure the 
system with specific features, which are documented with date and time. 
This is what is known as the configuration baseline.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-173">For example, you will not require Windows Media Player
 on a File server or a domain controller. You would simply remove this 
feature. When configuring the configuration baseline, you change the 
default settings and configure it based on a documented configuration. 
For example, you would remove unnecessary services, applications, and 
even the protocols. The key focus is to create a baseline and implement 
it on all systems that have the same role. You would have a 
configuration baseline for desktops, another one for laptops, and 
similarly, you would have baselines for servers, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-174">

<li id="cn-m7-174">Webserver</li>

<li id="cn-m7-175">File Server</li>

<li id="cn-m7-176">Print Server</li>

<li id="cn-m7-177">Database Server</li>

<li id="cn-m7-178">Domain Controller</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m7-179">When an organization uses the configuration baseline 
process, no system is installed without proper baseline configuration. A
 specific image would be deployed on the system or server, depending on 
the role it plays.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-180"><b>Hardening</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-181">Hardening is a process of reducing an attack surface 
on a system or application. While in the process of application 
hardening, you can perform various activities, such as patching the 
application, removing unused features, and closing vulnerabilities. You 
can also deploy certain security controls, such as a Web Application 
Firewall (WAF) or Transport Layer Security (TLS), if you are using a Web
 application.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-182">During host hardening, you can perform various steps. Some of these steps are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-183">

<li id="cn-m7-183">Removing unnecessary or unused applications.</li>

<li id="cn-m7-184">Disabling unnecessary services</li>

<li id="cn-m7-185">Blocking the unrequired ports</li>

<li id="cn-m7-186">Preventing the use of external media, such as USB drives</li>

<li id="cn-m7-187">Implementing Mandatory Access Control (MAC)</li>

<li id="cn-m7-188">Implementing patching on regular and need-basis</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m7-189">This is not an exhaustive list, but some of the key 
points. Other than this, you can also strengthen the security using 
Group Policy if it is a Windows system and is part of a domain.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-190">Several tools are available that can be used for 
testing of OS security although tools may differ from operating system 
to operating system. For example, even though discontinued, Microsoft 
Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) used to be a good tool for testing the
 security of a Windows platform.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-195"><b>Compensating Controls</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-196">Compensating controls are implemented for various 
reasons. They are typically the controls implemented because the primary
 controls are difficult / too expensive to implement. If the primary 
controls fail, then the compensating controls are activated. The intent 
of the compensating controls is similar to primary controls. They are 
designed and implemented to reduce the risk by providing an additional 
level of security.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-197">Examples of compensatory controls are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-198">

<li id="cn-m7-198"><b>Logs</b>: You should maintain and review these logs regularly</li>

<li id="cn-m7-199"><b>Audit trails</b>: An audit trail should be implemented for the events taking place within the system or network</li>

<li id="cn-m7-200"><b>Intrusion Detection System (IDS</b>): If it is not possible to prevent the attack, then you should be able to at least detect it</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m7-202">In a scenario where a primary control is either 
difficult or impossible to implement, you can implement compensating 
controls. You may have to implement more than one compensating control 
to meet the requirements of the primary control. When selecting a 
compensating control, you should be cautious enough to verify that the 
level of security that it provides should be equivalent to the primary 
control, which could not be implemented.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-203">With the compensating control, you should remember a few points:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-204">

<li id="cn-m7-204">It is also important that the cost of the compensating control should be less than the cost of assets that it is protecting.</li>

<li id="cn-m7-205">Its implementation should not take more time than the primary control.</li>

<li id="cn-m7-206">It should be implemented to reduce the risk of the asset.</li>

<li id="cn-m7-207">It should be implemented as a substitute for the 
primary control, which can be implemented, then you should avoid using 
compensating control.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m7-208"><b>Risk Acceptance</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-209">In an organization, you have to first assess risks to 
the assets. Once assessed, then you need to ensure that you have put in 
security controls or countermeasures to protect them. You will have to 
evaluate the risks, and accordingly, you need to treat the risks. You 
can use different methods in treating the risks. Primarily, there are 
four methods that you can use. Risk Acceptance is one method of treating
 risks to assets within the organization.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-210">Risk Acceptance is a risk treatment method in which an
 organization chooses to accept the risk and takes no further action. 
One of the reasons for this is that the cost of countermeasures is high.
 The loss that may occur due to the risk is lower than the cost of 
implementing the countermeasure.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-211">For example, the cost of the risk is about $1000. 
However, the cost of implementing the countermeasure is about $10,000. 
Therefore, the organization is willing to accept the risk.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-212">Other than Risk Acceptance, there are three more risk treatment methods. These are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-213">

<li id="cn-m7-213"><b>Risk Reduction</b>: When using the Risk Reduction 
method, the organization not only manages the risks but also implements 
the countermeasures to reduce the likelihood of risk occurrence.</li>

<li id="cn-m7-214"><b>Risk Transfer</b>: In this method, the risk is 
simply transferred to a third-party. For example, you may outsource the 
server management service to a third-party vendor who will be 
responsible for managing the servers, performing backups, and also 
restoration as and when required.</li>

<li id="cn-m7-215"><b>Risk Avoidance</b>: Using this method, the organization simply eliminate the services or activities that can lead to unnecessary risks.</li>

<p id="cn-m7-219">Over the last few years, cloud computing has become 
increasingly popular. Many organizations have moved from on-premises 
infrastructure to cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-220">Just like local infrastructure, cloud infrastructure has its own set of vulnerabilities and potential threats.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-221">In this exercise, you will learn about the types of cloud deployment models and their vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m7-223">After completing this exercise, you will have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-224">

<li id="cn-m7-224">Memorandum of Understandings (MOU)</li>

<li id="cn-m7-225">Service-level Agreements (SLA)</li>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Devices</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m7-232">This exercise contains supporting materials for CySA+.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-233"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m7-c-4" src="VulnerabilityIdentificationandRemediation_files/image-m7-c-4.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-234"><b>Memorandum of understanding (MOU)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-235"><b>MoU </b>lists the objectives of an agreement between two parties. An <b>MoU </b>is supported by the Interconnection Security Agreement (<b>ISA</b>). An MoU does not enforce any penalties and lists the objectives of the agreement between two parties. <b>MoU </b>focuses on the terms and conditions between the two parties. Even though <b>MoU </b>does not have any legal binding, but it does outline the objectives of two <b>parties </b>working together.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-236">Some of the key components of MoU are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-237">

<li id="cn-m7-237">Names of the parties</li>

<li id="cn-m7-238">Scope of the engagement between two parties</li>

<li id="cn-m7-239">Roles and responsibilities of the parties involved</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m7-240"><b>MoU </b>defines the agreement expectations between two parties. In most cases, <b>MoU </b>is between two parties. However, it can also be possible that there is a tri-party <b>MoU </b>in which there are three parties involved.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-241"><b>Service-level Agreement (SLA)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-242">There are typically two parties in an <b>SLA</b>, the organization and the vendor. An <b>SLA </b>is an agreement between both parties. The <b>SLA </b>defines
 the expectations that an organization requires the vendor to meet. It 
clearly defines the action plan, how it will be executed, timeline, and 
penalties for failure. An <b>SLA </b>document clearly defines the following:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-243">

<li id="cn-m7-243">an action plan</li>

<li id="cn-m7-244">how it will be executed</li>

<li id="cn-m7-245">timelines</li>

<li id="cn-m7-246">penalties for failure</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m7-247">The nature of an <b>SLA </b>will differ with the type of vendor. For example, an <b>SLA </b>document
 with a software developer will be different from the hardware vendor, 
who is responsible for maintaining the server and desktop hardware.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-248"><b>Organizational Governance</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-249">Organizational governance defines the processes that 
will be used for managing and controlling processes and operations that 
are running within an organization. Organizational governance is also 
used by organizations to meet their business objectives.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-250">An organization without organizational governance is 
headless and works blindly without knowing what to achieve. The role of 
organizational governance is to ensure that some processes and 
procedures provide insights as to how the operations are running. It 
helps the organization’s senior management gain insights into the 
day-to-day operational processes.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-251">In many cases, organizational governance is also a 
requirement imposed by regulatory requirements (a security policy is an 
example). A security policy within an organization focuses on the 
people, systems, and data to bring governance in place. When there are 
routine audits and compliance checks, you can find the gaps within the 
security policy implementation. Security policy intends to drive 
organizational governance in the IT domain.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-252"><b>Business Process Interruption</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-253">There will be certain vulnerabilities that will exist 
within an IT environment in your organization. You need to plan for the 
mitigation of these vulnerabilities. However, when implementing 
mitigations, you need to ensure that you do not disrupt any business 
operations or running processes.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-254">Disrupting the business processes and operations can 
be quite chaotic as they can bring the business operations to a halt. 
Therefore, mitigations should be planned to proceed out of business 
hours so that there are minimal disruptions.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-255"><b>Degrading Functionality</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-256">There can be a possibility that a solution you 
implement may cause more damage than rectify. Some solutions may also 
degrade existing functionality. For example, if a network interface card
 (<b>NIC</b>) of one of the servers has gone bad and you replace it with
 an older one. This will degrade the network speed for the system. 
Whereas the original may have been 1 Gbps NIC, and you have changed it 
to 100 Mbps.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-257">For a desktop, it may not matter to that extent, but 
think if this was done with a Webserver. It would cause slowness in 
responding to the queries that are generated through the Web application
 it is hosting. Therefore, while implementing a solution, you need to be
 cautious about degrading functionality.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-258"><b>Legacy Systems</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-259">Legacy systems are systems that are outdated as per 
the current technology standards. Legacy systems do not use the current 
architecture or the system design in comparison to what is in use at 
present. For example, Windows 7 was one of the key operating systems 
from Microsoft. However, with the current operating system, Windows 10, 
it became obsolete because Windows 10 adopted the new interface, new 
architecture, and had better functionality and security. Therefore, 
Windows 7 is now considered to be a legacy operating system.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-260">Similarly, if you refer to an old system, Pentium, it 
is obsolete because the current systems use new processors and memory 
modules. The new processors are using i3, i5, or i7 processors with the 
DDR4 memory modules. None of these are supported by a Pentium system.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-261">Even though obsolete systems do not support the new 
architecture and technology, they are often still used. This is because 
you or your organization may be running an application on a server that 
uses obsolete hardware. You do not want to move the application from 
this server, and therefore, you are forced to use the legacy server. 
Similarly, you may also be using the legacy application. It could be 
because the data in the legacy system cannot be exported to the new 
application, or you simply do not have a new application that provides 
the same features or functionality.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-262">It is also true that the legacy systems cannot 
sometimes be used with new regulations or compliance standards. This is 
because they do not provide or support the same level of security that 
is required by the new regulations or standards.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-263"><b>Proprietary Systems</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-264">Proprietary systems often use specific data formats, 
which cannot be easily integrated with the other systems. For example, 
Windows is a proprietary operating system by Microsoft, who maintains 
the permissions and privileges of adding and removing features as and 
when required.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-265">One of the key advantages of a proprietary system is 
that it is designed to meet a specific purpose and provides a better 
user experience. With proprietary systems, some regular updates or 
upgrades are released by the organization that owns the product.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-266">A proprietary system can be hardware or software. An 
example of hardware can be the Core i5 processor by Intel. Windows is an
 example of a proprietary operating system. The drawback of a 
proprietary system can be that it would either have an upfront cost, 
which means that you purchase and pay the cost. Another can be that you 
have a subscription fee to use it. Then, there are typically maintenance
 or service charges.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-270">Patching the system requires the system to be updated 
from time to time with the latest version of packages. Updates can be 
deployed in two different ways:</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-283"><b>Task 1 - Install Updates Manually</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-284">Packages may need to be upgraded from time to time
