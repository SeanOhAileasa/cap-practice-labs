</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m29-55"><b>Frameworks</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m29-56">A framework or a security framework defines a set of 
processes and procedures to help an organization implement a set of 
security controls, which are meant to reduce the security risks. A 
framework can be specific to an industry, or it could be generalized to 
meet more generic requirements. For example, <b>PCI</b>-<b>DSS </b>is a 
regulatory framework for an organization that deals with credit or debit
 card payments on the Internet. This is specific to the credit card 
industry. On the other hand, <b>ISO 27001 </b>is a more general regulatory framework that can help any organization of any size. It helps an organization to define an <b>Information Security Management System </b>(<b>ISMS</b>).</p>

<p id="cn-m29-57">The whole intent of a framework is to use the 
pre-defined guidelines. When you use a specific framework, you do not 
need to create the basic structure of policies and processes. However, 
it is important to note that a framework can always be customized to 
meet an organization’s needs.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-58">There are several frameworks available in the IT 
industry, and most of them are designed with the security aspect in 
mind. Broadly categorizing, there are two types of frameworks, <b>prescriptive </b>and <b>risk based</b>.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m29-59"><b><i>Prescriptive Framework</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-60">Prescriptive frameworks define a specific direction or
 a series of steps, which can be in the form of procedures. The 
framework contains a series of steps that must be followed to meet a 
specific requirement. The prescriptive frameworks are designed with two 
goals in mind:</p>

<ul id="cn-m29-61">

<li id="cn-m29-61">What to do</li>

<li id="cn-m29-62">When to do</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m29-63"><b>Prescriptive </b>frameworks bring in 
standardization and, therefore, can be difficult to implement. They are 
large frameworks, and the cost to implement them can also be high. In 
totality, the prescriptive frameworks are one-size fit all.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-64"><b>Prescriptive </b>frameworks, because they offer 
standardization, they follow the template-based approach and provide 
instructions to solve a specific issue or problem. <b>Waterfall </b>methodology can be considered as a prescriptive framework as it provides detailed steps as to what to do and when to do.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-65"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m29-c-2" src="FrameworksControlsPoliciesandProcedures_files/image-m29-c-2.jpg" alt="Figure 1.1"><figcaption>Figure
 1.1: Example of the Waterfall model, which shows three headings, 
Requirements, Time and Implementation and shows that they lead into one 
another.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<h4 id="cn-m29-66"><b><i>Risk-based Framework</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-67">Unlike <b>Prescriptive </b>frameworks, <b>Risk-Based </b>frameworks
 are used to identify specific risks in systems. Once the risks are 
identified, you can design the controls to mitigate risks.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-68">The <b>Risk-Based </b>frameworks follow a series of 
steps. The first step starts by identifying the risk factors and then 
moves on to assess the level of risks. After you assess the risks, you 
need to understand the impact of specific risk and build a mitigation 
plan accordingly.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-69"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m29-c-3" src="FrameworksControlsPoliciesandProcedures_files/image-m29-c-3.jpg" alt="This image is described in the fig caption that follows this image."><figcaption>Figure
 1.2 Diagram showing the mitigation plan; Identify risk factors &gt; 
Assessing risk levels &gt; Understanding the risk impact and Execute the
 mitigation plan.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m29-70"><b>Risk-Based </b>frameworks require less extensive 
documentation and are typically less costly and time-consuming. This is 
because you are more inclined to find a risk rather than how a task can 
be accomplished.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-71">A risk-based framework helps you achieve the following:</p>

<ul id="cn-m29-72">

<li id="cn-m29-72">Perform risk identification and risk assessment</li>

<li id="cn-m29-73">Define the level of risk tolerance</li>

<li id="cn-m29-74">Define a score to the risk</li>

<li id="cn-m29-75">Define a response to the risk</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m29-76">Several <b>Risk</b>-<b>Based </b>frameworks help an organization manage and assess risks:</p>

<ul id="cn-m29-77">

<li id="cn-m29-77">Operationally Critical Threat, Asset and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE)</li>

<li id="cn-m29-78">Factor Analysis of Information Risks (FAIR)</li>

<li id="cn-m29-79">National Institute of Standards and Technology's Risk Management Framework (NIST RMF)</li>

<li id="cn-m29-80">Threat Agent Risk Assessment (TARA)</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m29-81"><b>Policies and Procedures</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m29-82">A policy is a set of principles or guidelines that 
must define an objective for the organization. Procedures, on the other 
hand, are derived from the policies and are set of steps that must be 
performed to meet a goal or objective. For example, creating a user 
account in the organization’s domain is a procedure that must be 
followed.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-83">An organization in any kind of industry will have some
 sort of policies and procedures. In the context of security, the 
organization will have policies and procedures related to security to 
ensure the protection of their critical assets. For example, a data 
security policy defines how you need to secure your data by applying 
encryption. An access control policy defines how access is granted to 
the users in your organization.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-84">In most cases, organizations have some sort of <b>Information Security Management System </b>(<b>ISMS</b>)
 in which they define various policies and procedures. However, it is 
important to note that the policies and procedures must be defined to 
meet one or more specific business objectives.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m29-85"><b><i>Code of Conduct/Ethics</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-86">Several organizations will implement <b>ISMS </b>to establish policies and procedures, which define the security controls for protecting the infrastructure. <b>ISMS </b>also
 contains the policies that define how users should comply with the 
defined rules and guidelines. Organizations mostly require the users to 
sign the code of conduct policy, which defines how the users should work
 with the existing infrastructure and the type of conduct that they 
should follow when dealing with the information.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-87">The code of conduct needs to be signed by every 
employee in the organization. This includes the leadership of the 
employee at the bottom of the hierarchy. It is important to understand 
that the code of conduct is the responsibility of every employee in the 
organization. The employees must read the code of conduct policy and 
also sign it to with the proper understanding of the contents mentioned 
inside it. Needless to say that there will be users who do not comply 
with it. In case of any non-compliance, the matter can be escalated 
accordingly.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m29-88"><b><i>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-89">An <b>Acceptable Use Policy </b>(<b>AUP</b>) can also 
be known as an acceptable usage policy or fair use policy. The core 
intent of this policy is to define guidelines on how the users must use 
the systems, network, E-mail, and the Internet within the organization. 
An AUP can be used by different entities, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m29-90">

<li id="cn-m29-90">Corporations</li>

<li id="cn-m29-91">Businesses</li>

<li id="cn-m29-92">Universities and schools</li>

<li id="cn-m29-93">Internet Service Providers (ISPs)</li>

<li id="cn-m29-94">Website owners</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m29-95">In an organization, when a new user joins, they need 
to sign the AUP. After the signing of the AUP, access to the system and 
network is granted to the user. The AUP also mentions the consequences 
that can be imposed on the user if they violate any guidelines mentioned
 in the AUP.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptable_use_policy" class="cn-external-link" target="_blank"></a></p>

<p id="cn-m29-96">Sample AUP:</p>

<pre id="cn-m29-97"><code>https://www.quora.com/about/acceptable_use

</code></pre>

<h4 id="cn-m29-98"><b><i>Password Policy</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-99">An organization can have various information security 
policies. A password policy is also included in these policies as a user
 account is a critical component in a network environment. A password 
policy enforces the use of strong and complex passwords. Users tend to 
keep the passwords that are easy to remember, such as a family member’s 
name or their pet’s name. Some users also use some of their favorite 
dictionary words as passwords. To prevent users from using simple 
passwords, password policy is enforced.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-100">Most operating systems, such as Windows Server, allow
 you to enforce a password policy using Group Policy. The system 
administrator can enforce this policy to all domain users at once. With 
the password policy, a user can be forced to do the following:</p>

<ul id="cn-m29-101">

<li id="cn-m29-101">Use a complex password (including letters, numbers, and special characters)</li>

<li id="cn-m29-102">Use a minimum of 8 characters in the password</li>

<li id="cn-m29-103">Prevent repeated use of the last few passwords (such as the last 5 used passwords cannot be reused)</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m29-104">The password policy must be supported by a tool, which in this case, is <b>Group Policy </b>in <b>Windows Server</b>.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m29-105"><b><i>Data Ownership</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-106">The data ownership policy defines the management and 
access to the data within an organization. It can also define the roles 
and responsibilities of different entities, such as data steward and 
data owner. It focuses on defining the access based on the jobs that the
 users are going to perform and authorizations that will be granted to 
them to the data.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m29-107"><b><i>Data Retention</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-108">A data retention policy focuses on data retention to 
meet either the operational, law, or regulation-based requirements. The 
data retention policy should define how the data should be stored and 
searched later if required. The policy should also focus on the data 
that is not required and how it can be disposed of.</p>

<span class="cn-quote" id="cn-m29-109"><b><i>Note: </i></b><i>It is 
important to note that the data retention policy should be focused and 
aligned with the business objectives. It should also account for any 
specific laws and regulations, such as HIPAA. </i></span>

<h4 id="cn-m29-110"><b><i>Account Management</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-111">The account management policy defines how user 
accounts are created and deleted within an organization’s 
infrastructure. It also covers the aspect of control and supervision of 
these accounts, which will be given access to the system and network 
resources. This policy is typically applied to all user accounts within 
an organization. It is defined to cover different types of accounts, 
such as general user accounts, administrative accounts, 
application-specific accounts, vendor accounts, and guest accounts.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m29-112"><b><i>Continuous Monitoring</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-113">Continuous monitoring is about ensuring that the 
infrastructure is meeting the set compliance. In case of any deviation 
from compliance, you can detect it using continuous monitoring. With 
continuous monitoring, you can also detect risks, which, otherwise, 
would not have been detected or detected much later.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-114">In the entire lifecycle of IT Operations, you can 
integrate continuous monitoring to health, performance, and reliability 
of the IT infrastructure. With the implementation of continuous 
monitoring, you find events that are unplanned and have taken place, 
causing threats and risks to the infrastructure assets. Without 
continuous monitoring, it would not be possible to track the threats 
instantly. You may perform monitoring and auditing at a scheduled 
interval, which means that the threat will exist in the infrastructure 
until that time. It is important to note that continuous monitoring can 
prevent threats on the software, hardware, network, storage, and in 
fact, anything that is involved in the infrastructure.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m29-115"><b><i>Work Product Retention</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-116">Employees are given certain information and assets to
 work. In the context of the work product retention method, the 
organization has ownership of all the assets. Any asset that is used by 
the employee will remain the asset of the organization.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m29-117"><b><i>Communication Plan</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-118">Communication plans are integral when working in a 
wide team in order to deliver a specific project. Typically, 
communication plans are used in order to outline how each stage of a 
project will be discussed internally and how updates will be 
disseminated to stakeholders, although they can be used at any level in a
 business and it depends on what type of industry you work in as to how 
these are utilized. Although more helpful for bigger organizations with 
multiple teams, they can also be used in smaller teams to allocate 
responsibility to different members of staff.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-119">Let’s look at a sample using <b>PLABWIN10</b>.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m29-120"><b><i>Step 1</i></b></h4>

<h3 id="cn-m29-135"><b>Security Control Categories</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m29-136">Irrespective of the size of an IT infrastructure, you
 would want to protect it from different types of security threats. To 
be able to do that, you need to apply different security measures and 
ensure that the organization’s assets are protected and safeguarded. 
These security measures are known as security controls, which help you 
protect the infrastructure, be it physical or logical.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-137">The security controls are implemented to handle risks
 in different ways. They can be implemented to protect the 
infrastructure by reducing or eliminating the risks. There is no fixed 
method of applying security controls in the infrastructure. The number 
of security controls will depend entirely on the architecture of the 
infrastructure. The size of the infrastructure and nature of business 
has also be accounted for when implementing security controls.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-138">It is important to note that no control works in 
isolation. Multiple controls together must be layered, which is known as
 defense-in-depth. Most of the security administrators make a mistake of
 adding too many security controls to protect the infrastructure. 
However, this adds to the complexity of the infrastructure. Therefore, 
there must be an administrative policy that should drive a reason for 
implementing control, which must be measurable, effective, objective, 
and enforceable.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-139">When selecting a security control, you should know 
that security control must involve four key entities, which are people, 
processes, operations, and technology. Also, the security controls must 
be designed to protect the assets and, more specifically, the 
information for confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and 
availability.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-140">There are three different categories of security controls:</p>

<ul id="cn-m29-141">

<li id="cn-m29-141">Administrative</li>

<li id="cn-m29-142">Technical</li>

<li id="cn-m29-143">Physical</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m29-144">Let’s look at each of these categories in detail.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m29-145"><b><i>Administrative</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-146">Administrative controls are implemented and applied 
to the individuals within an organization. The idea of administrative 
controls is to lay down a set of rules that must be adhered to. Some of 
the key examples are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m29-147">

<li id="cn-m29-147">Training</li>

<li id="cn-m29-148">Personnel recruitment</li>

<li id="cn-m29-149">Change management</li>

<li id="cn-m29-150">Access management</li>

<li id="cn-m29-151">Employee screening</li>

<li id="cn-m29-152">Certification programs</li>

<li id="cn-m29-153">Non-disclosure agreements (NDA)</li>

<li id="cn-m29-154">Disaster preparedness and recovery plans</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m29-155"><b><i>Technical</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-156">The technical controls are also known as logical 
controls, which apply to the systems and devices. These controls can be 
in the software or hardware forms that are used to protect the 
information assets.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-157">Some of the key examples are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m29-158">

<li id="cn-m29-158">Encryption</li>

<li id="cn-m29-159">Smart cards</li>

<li id="cn-m29-160">Passwords</li>

<li id="cn-m29-161">Firewalls</li>

<li id="cn-m29-162">Routers</li>

<li id="cn-m29-163">Network Authentication</li>

<li id="cn-m29-164">Access Control Lists (ACLs)</li>

<li id="cn-m29-165">Intrusion detection systems</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m29-167"><b><i>Physical</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-168">The physical controls are designed to prevent any 
unauthorized access to the physical location of the datacenter and the 
entire infrastructure. Some of the key examples are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m29-169">

<li id="cn-m29-169">Barricades</li>

<li id="cn-m29-170">Locked doors</li>

<li id="cn-m29-171">Alarm systems</li>

<li id="cn-m29-172">Security guards</li>

<li id="cn-m29-173">Surveillance cameras</li>

<li id="cn-m29-174">Dead-bolted steel doors</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m29-176"><b><i>Control Types</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-177">Each of the control categories can have various types of security controls, which are primarily:</p>

<ul id="cn-m29-178">

<li id="cn-m29-178"><b>Directive</b>: Directs the users to a specific 
positive behavior. These controls are implemented when you want to 
direct the users or employees to acceptable behavior.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-179"><b>Preventive</b>: Prevents undesirable events, which can be a risk or a threat, to occur.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-180"><b>Detective</b>: Identifies a security risk, which can be present in a policy, process, or procedure.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-181"><b>Deterrent</b>: Poses a warning that displays the consequences of unacceptable behavior.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-182"><b>Corrective</b>: Defines measures that are designed to react to an incident. These controls are used to either reduce or eliminate a threat.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-183"><b>Recovery</b>: Are used for restoring a system after an incident.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-184"><b>Compensating</b>: Are alternative controls that 
can be used in place of security control that was difficult to 
implement. The compensating control works similarly to the original 
security control.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m29-185">Let’s look at examples of each of these controls in the security control categories.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m29-186"><b><i>Administrative</i></b></h4>

<ul id="cn-m29-187">

<li id="cn-m29-187"><b>Directive</b>: Policies, guidelines</li>

<li id="cn-m29-188"><b>Preventive</b>: Non-disclosure Agreement (NDA), Separation of Duties, Warning Banner</li>

<li id="cn-m29-189"><b>Detective</b>: Investigation, log reviews</li>

<li id="cn-m29-190"><b>Deterrent</b>: Demotion</li>

<li id="cn-m29-191"><b>Corrective</b>: Penalty, administrative leave, termination</li>

<li id="cn-m29-192"><b>Recovery</b>: Business Continuity Planning (BCP), Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP)</li>

<li id="cn-m29-193"><b>Compensating</b>: Supervision, job rotation</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m29-194"><b><i>Technical</i></b></h4>

<ul id="cn-m29-195">

<li id="cn-m29-195"><b>Directive</b>: Standards</li>

<li id="cn-m29-196"><b>Preventive</b>: User authentication, multi-factor authentication, firewalls, Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), encryption</li>

<li id="cn-m29-197"><b>Detective</b>: Intrusion Detection System (IDS), SNMP</li>

<li id="cn-m29-198"><b>Deterrent</b>: Violation report</li>

<li id="cn-m29-199"><b>Corrective</b>: Update of access privileges, change in firewall policies</li>

<li id="cn-m29-200"><b>Recovery</b>: Backups, rebuilding the system</li>

<li id="cn-m29-201"><b>Compensating</b>: Keyboard logging</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m29-202"><b><i>Physical</i></b></h4>

<ul id="cn-m29-203">

<li id="cn-m29-203"><b>Directive</b>: Security guard</li>

<li id="cn-m29-204"><b>Preventive</b>: Fences, bollards</li>

<li id="cn-m29-205"><b>Detective</b>: CCTV, sensors</li>

<li id="cn-m29-206"><b>Deterrent</b>: Warning sign (Beware of dog)</li>

<li id="cn-m29-207"><b>Corrective</b>: Fire extinguishers</li>

<li id="cn-m29-208"><b>Recovery</b>: Reconstruct, rebuild</li>

<li id="cn-m29-209"><b>Compensating</b>: Layered defenses</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m29-210"><b>Audits and Assessments</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m29-211">An audit is a review to ensure that the users are 
following the set policies or processes. A system audit works in the 
same manner except that it focuses on the systems to evaluate if they 
are configured to comply with the set policies and procedures. Another 
aspect of the system audit is to focus on the users how they are 
following the set processes and policies. The key intent of running the 
system audit is to ensure that you can discover the compliance and 
security related loopholes.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-212">Depending on how a policy or procedure is defined, it
 has a specific focus area. The systems or the users are audited against
 the specific policy or procedure. A system audit can be performed 
against some of the following key components:</p>

<ul id="cn-m29-213">

<li id="cn-m29-213">Network and system architecture</li>

<li id="cn-m29-214">User management (creation and deletion)</li>

<li id="cn-m29-215">Operating system and its configuration</li>

<li id="cn-m29-216">Applications</li>

<li id="cn-m29-217">Database servers and databases</li>

<li id="cn-m29-218">Network configuration</li>

<li id="cn-m29-219">Logging process</li>

<li id="cn-m29-220">Backups and restore</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m29-221">When you perform a system audit, you are likely to 
discover several non-conformances, which can exist due to various 
reasons. Some of the key reasons could be due to negligence, 
misconfigurations, or missing security controls. Several of 
non-compliance issues can be handled with the alignment of the existing 
security controls, replacing them, or adding new ones.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m29-222"><b><i>Regulatory and Compliance Policy</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-223">A Regulatory and Compliance Policy defines the 
principles and standards for compliance and management of compliance 
risks in an organization. It ensures two key things:</p>

<ul id="cn-m29-224">

<li id="cn-m29-224">Compliance risks are identified</li>

<li id="cn-m29-225">Compliance risks mitigated adequately</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m29-226">This policy applies to all business units, functions,
 and employees. The senior management or the organization is responsible
 for enforcing this policy.</p>
