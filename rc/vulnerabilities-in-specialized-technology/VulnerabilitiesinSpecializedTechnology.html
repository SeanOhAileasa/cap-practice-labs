<p id="cn-m12-47">In today’s world, you are likely to be using a 
specialized technology, which is designed for a specific purpose. There 
can be various examples of specialized technologies, such as the 
Internet of Things (<b>IoT</b>), mobile, embedded systems, or even supervisory control and data acquisition (<b>SCADA</b>). Each one of these technologies is designed to serve a specific purpose.</p>

<p id="cn-m12-48">However, most of these technologies are complex. There
 may be millions of lines of code that are built into different 
components of the technology, such as an autonomous vehicle. With the 
large codebase, there are bound to be vulnerabilities that are 
introduced.</p>

<p id="cn-m12-49">In this exercise, you will learn about the types of technologies and the vulnerabilities that they may contain.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m12-65"><b>Mobile </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m12-66">The Open Web Application Security Project (<b>OWASP</b>) performs extensive research and has released to the Top 10 Mobile Threats in 2016.</p>

<p id="cn-m12-67">Here is the list of Top 10 Mobile Threats:</p>

<h4 id="cn-m12-68"><b><i>1. Improper Platform Usage</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-69">Certain features may be built on mobile apps that are 
meant only for the developers. However, if the hacker knows these 
features, the entire mobile app is at risk of exploitation.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m12-70"><b><i>2. Insecure Data Storage</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-71">Sometimes, developers do not efficiently handle data 
in storage. For example, a hacker may be able to extract data from a 
cache if it is not cleared or encrypted.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m12-72"><b><i>3. Insecure Communication</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-73">Insecure communication relates to several vulnerabilities, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m12-74">

<li id="cn-m12-74"><b>poor handshaking / weak negotiation </b>- A handshake between the client and the server using a weak protocol, such as SSL instead of TLS, which has replaced SSL.</li>

<li id="cn-m12-75"><b>Incorrect SSL version usage </b>- Using an older version of SSL, such as version 1.1, which has security weaknesses.</li>

<li id="cn-m12-76"><b>Certificate issue </b>- Use of expired certificates.</li>

<li id="cn-m12-77"><b>Cleartext communication of sensitive information </b>-
 use of HTTP protocol instead of HTTPS when exchanging sensitive 
information. The HTTP protocol sends information in clear text that can 
be intercepted and read by hackers. HTTPS sends information in an 
encrypted format.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m12-78">Even though developers may be cautious about 
encrypting data at reset, they can forget to encrypt the data in 
transit. This means that data is being sent in cleartext, which can be 
captured, read, or modified by a hacker.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m12-79"><b><i>4. Insecure Authentication</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-80">Most mobile apps use offline authentication, which 
does not require the user to authenticate with an online server. A 
hacker can use a custom tool to bypass the local authentication method 
to gain access to the data stored in the app. Insecure authentication 
also includes improper session management. The sessions, if not closed 
properly, can allow the hacker to gain access to the mobile app and its 
data.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m12-81"><b><i>5. Insufficient Cryptography</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-82">If a developer does not implement sufficient or proper
 cryptography, which is a method to conceal information in a format that
 no one other than the intended party can understand, the hacker can 
decrypt the insufficient cryptography to gain access to data. This 
problem can arise due to poor cryptography or flawed 
encryption/decryption procedures implemented in the mobile app code.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m12-83"><b><i>6. Insecure Authorization</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-84">Insecure authorization refers to the server-side 
vulnerabilities during authorization. If permissions are not checked 
properly when a user accesses a feature, it can also allow the hacker 
access to exploit features.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m12-85"><b><i>7. Client Code Quality</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-86">Client code quality refers to mistakes made by 
developers in the mobile app code. The two most common errors to client 
code are buffer overflow and memory leaks. In buffer overflows, a 
program attempts to write more data to the buffer than it can handle. In
 memory leaks, an application does not release the memory that it had 
consumed but is now no longer required. These can allow the hacker to 
gain control over the mobile app. This can lead to data theft and 
control over mobile devices.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m12-87"><b><i>8. Code Tempering</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-88">After a mobile app is downloaded to a device, its code
 is resident on the mobile. A hacker can perform code tempering, which 
is modifying the code, stealing information, change the Application 
Programming Interface (<b>API</b>), which allows two applications to 
connect or access premium features of the mobile app, which otherwise 
would be locked. In the worst-case scenario, a piece of malicious code 
could be added to the mobile app’s code. The modified mobile app could 
then be distributed through genuine mobile app stores.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m12-89"><b><i>9. Reverse Engineering</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-90">Mobile apps can be reverse engineered. A hacker may 
reverse engineer a mobile app to study its functionality and find 
vulnerabilities that may exist in the code. For example, if the 
developer has included user credentials as a backdoor, then the hacker 
can use it for data theft. Backdoor malware is used to create an entry 
in a fully functional system. Typically, developers leave hardcoded 
credentials within an application to later connect with it in case there
 is an issue in connecting with the application. Similarly, if the 
hacker discovers a backdoor, it allows the attacker to remotely control 
the user’s system without his or her knowledge. The attacker has the 
full control of the system.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m12-91"><b><i>10. Extraneous Functionality</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-92">During the development of a mobile app, the developers
 often include features that can help them during testing. However, 
these features are not always removed when the app is released to 
production, but they are hidden from the users. When looking for 
extraneous functionality, the hacker does not interact with the user’s 
mobile device or its apps. The app is downloaded locally to his or her 
mobile device by the hacker and then analyzed for the extraneous 
functionality. Once any type of extraneous functionality is found, it is
 then used to exploit the user devices.</p>

<p id="cn-m12-93">There are various types of mobile malware, such as:</p>

<ol id="cn-m12-94">

<li id="cn-m12-94"><b>Spyware </b>- When invoked in a user’s system, 
spyware sits quietly without alerting the user and gathers information 
without their consent. The attacker controlling the spyware captures the
 information by logging the keystrokes generated by the user.</li>

<li id="cn-m12-95"><b>Madware </b>- It is a form of aggressive 
advertising on Android mobiles and tablets. It is intrusive and can 
download spyware on the device. The spyware can steal the user’s 
sensitive information.</li>

<li id="cn-m12-96"><b>Virus </b>- A&nbsp;virus&nbsp;is a type of malware
 that either inserts or attaches itself to a legitimate program and 
infects it. A virus is designed to cause damage to a system. For 
example, it can corrupt installed applications.</li>

<li id="cn-m12-97"><b>Trojan Horse </b>- Trojan horse is a malware that 
masquerades itself as a legitimate application to hide its real 
function, which is to steal information from a computer system. The user
 cannot tell the difference between a trojan or a normal application. 
When the user triggers the trojan application, it causes damage to the 
data and the system.</li>

<li id="cn-m12-98"><b>Browser exploits </b>- It is a type of malicious 
code that alters the Web browser’s security settings. Its main intent is
 to exploit the vulnerabilities that may exist within the operating 
system or any installed application.</li>

</ol>

<h3 id="cn-m12-99"><b>Methods</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m12-100"><b>Drive-by-downloads </b>- Is a method using 
malicious code that is downloaded to mobile devices or a system. When a 
user visits an infected Website, a small piece of code, which is 
inserted by the hacker, is executed. This piece of code connects to 
another system and downloads the remaining code on your system. Using 
the downloaded code, the hacker can connect to your system remotely.</p>

<p id="cn-m12-101"><b>Phishing </b>- Phishing itself is not malware, but
 instead a method that is used to deliver malware to a user’s system. In
 phishing, an E-mail carries a malicious file to the user’s mailbox. 
When the user opens or executes the malicious file, it triggers the 
malware on the user’s system.</p>

<p id="cn-m12-102">There can be different distribution methods, such as:</p>

<ol id="cn-m12-103">

<li id="cn-m12-103">Email</li>

<li id="cn-m12-104">Instant Messaging</li>

<li id="cn-m12-105">Bluetooth</li>

<li id="cn-m12-106">Memory cards</li>

<li id="cn-m12-107">Wi-Fi</li>

</ol>

<p id="cn-m12-108">A common method used to spread malware is by 
infecting an app, which is stored in Play Store or any other trusted app
 repository. When the users download and install this app, their mobile 
devices are infected.</p>

<p id="cn-m12-109">When a mobile device is infected with malware, it can:</p>

<ol id="cn-m12-110">

<li id="cn-m12-110">Monitor the mobile device and activities performed</li>

<li id="cn-m12-111">Capture any kind of messaging, such as Email and text messages, being sent or received</li>

<li id="cn-m12-112">Record conversations in silent mode when the phone is not being used</li>

<li id="cn-m12-113">Cause disruptions to the mobile device operating system and installed apps</li>

<li id="cn-m12-114">Delete data, such as contacts</li>

</ol>

<h4 id="cn-m12-115"><b><i>Mobile Application Vulnerabilities</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-116">Some of the key issues with mobile applications are:</p>

<p id="cn-m12-117"><b>Data Storage Formats</b>: When a mobile app is 
developed, developers do not tend to encrypt data stored within the app.
 Instead, the data is stored in a clear text or XML format. If someone 
gains access to the mobile device, the data can be easily read and 
extracted.</p>

<p id="cn-m12-118"><b>Malware</b>: This is more of an issue with 
Android-specific apps. Apple uses stringent practices to verify an app 
before it is submitted to their repository. Android, on the other hand, 
uses a Play Store, which allows anyone to submit an app. Unless you have
 an antimalware installed on your mobile device, you cannot be sure that
 you are downloading a safe app from the Play Store.</p>

<p id="cn-m12-119"><b>Unauthorized Access</b>: Users often do not put a 
lock or password on their mobile devices. In case that a device is 
stolen or lost, it can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive 
information. Another example can be of malware, which can access 
sensitive information stored on mobile devices.</p>

<p id="cn-m12-120"><b>Lack of Encryption</b>: Several apps use the 
synchronization feature to upload user data to their servers. However, 
if data is not encrypted during transmission, it is prone to 
unauthorized access.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m12-121"><b><i>Threats to Bluetooth Devices</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-122">Bluetooth is an open standard wireless technology 
that is used to exchange information and files between two devices. 
Bluetooth works only with short-range radio frequencies. When two 
devices connect using a Bluetooth connection, they create a Wireless 
Personal Area Network (<b>WPAN</b>).</p>

<p id="cn-m12-123">Some threats to Bluetooth devices are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m12-124">

<li id="cn-m12-124"><b>Bluejacking </b>- Sends an unsolicited message to another device that has its Bluetooth connection open.</li>

<li id="cn-m12-125"><b>Bluesniping </b>- Uses a directional antenna to 
establish connections with Bluetooth-enabled devices. Bluetooth has a 
distance limitation, which may prevent a hacker from establishing a 
connection. In this situation, the hacker can use a directional antenna 
to establish connections for up to a mile (1.6 kilometers).</li>

<li id="cn-m12-126"><b>Bluesnarfing </b>- Uses the Bluejacking method to
 connect to the device, then gain access to the address book, contact 
information, email, and text messages.</li>

<li id="cn-m12-127"><b>War Nibbling/Bluecasing </b>- A hacker tries to 
find unsecured or unpatched Bluetooth connections, then steal 
information. War Nibbling is similar to War Diving, which is performed 
on a wireless network.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m12-128"><b>Internet of Things (IoT)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m12-129">An <b>IoT </b>device is hardware that can communicate with other devices and send data over the Internet. Each <b>IoT </b>device has an IP address that can be used for communication with other <b>IoT </b>devices, as well as remote monitoring and controlling. At present, <b>IoT </b>devices
 are being used across various industries, such as consumer electronics,
 travel, energy, healthcare, agriculture, and security.</p>

<p id="cn-m12-130">Even though the use of <b>IoT </b>devices has 
increased over the last few years, there are some vulnerabilities that 
put devices at risk. Just like mobile vulnerabilities, <b>OWASP </b>has also released the top 10 vulnerabilities for <b>IoT</b>. These vulnerabilities are as follows:</p>

<h4 id="cn-m12-131"><b><i>1. Weak, Guessable, or Hardcoded Passwords</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-132"><b>IoT </b>devices can have hardcoded passwords, or 
use default passwords are either weak or guessable. Hardcoded passwords 
can be defined for backdoor entry into <b>IoT </b>devices. However, these passwords can be brute forced. In some cases, the default password cannot be changed.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m12-133"><b><i>2. Insecure Network Services </i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-134"><b>IoT </b>devices use insecure network services that
 are exposed to the Internet. The insecure network services can 
compromise the integrity, confidentiality, availability, and privacy of 
the information being exchanged.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m12-135"><b><i>3. Insecure Ecosystem Interfaces</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-136">Insecure interfaces, such as Application Programming Interfaces (<b>APIs</b>),
 can lead to the compromise of the information, where integrity, 
confidentiality, availability, and privacy, can be lost for the 
information. The <b>APIs </b>or interfaces do not use secure encryption methods or authentication.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m12-137"><b><i>4. Lack of Secure Update Mechanism </i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-138">With the <b>IoT </b>devices, there is an issue in a 
secure update of the device’s firmware. There is no validation being 
performed on the firmware, and also there is no method to rollback to 
the previous firmware.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m12-139"><b><i>5. Use of Insecure or Outdated Components</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-140">The <b>IoT </b>devices also suffer from the 
components that are either insecure or outdated, which can include the 
operating system and software that is running. Insecure or outdated 
software or operating systems are bound to have vulnerabilities and, 
therefore, can be exploited.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m12-141"><b><i>6. Insecure Privacy Protection </i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-142">A user’s personal or collected information can be 
compromised if the device is hacked. The information is stored in an 
insecure fashion or exchanged with other devices without user 
permission.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m12-143"><b><i>7. Insecure Data Transfer and Storage </i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-144">Data is not encrypted when it is in storage or transmission.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m12-145"><b><i>8. Lack of Device Management </i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-146">There is no proper device management. There is no 
asset management or secure method of commissioning or decommissioning of
 devices.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m12-147"><b><i>9. Insecure Default Settings </i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-148">Most <b>IoT </b>devices are shipped with insecure 
default settings. It could also be possible that there are no possible 
methods to change a default configuration. Users, in most cases, use the
 <b>IoT </b>devices with the default configuration.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m12-149"><b><i>10. Lack of Physical Hardening </i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m12-150">Unlike a system or a laptop, there is hardly any physical hardening of <b>IoT </b>devices, which allows them to be controlled remotely by an attacker. This could lead to the compromise of sensitive information.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m12-151"><b>Embedded Systems</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m12-152">Embedded systems are devices that can perform certain functions on their own with the help of a central processing unit (<b>CPU</b>), an operating system, and applications that they run. Some of the key examples of an embedded system are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m12-153">

<li id="cn-m12-153">Automatic Teller Machine (<b>ATM</b>)</li>

<li id="cn-m12-154">Printers</li>

<li id="cn-m12-155">Thermostats</li>

<li id="cn-m12-156">Digital watches</li>

<li id="cn-m12-157">Digital cameras</li>

<li id="cn-m12-158">Automobiles</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m12-159">If an embedded system has the capability of connecting to the Internet, then it becomes part of <b>IoT </b>devices. This is quite common nowadays, where an embedded system is an <b>IoT </b>device. If it is, then the same <b>IoT </b>vulnerabilities may apply.</p>

<p id="cn-m12-160">Other than <b>IoT </b>vulnerabilities, an embedded system can also have the following vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul id="cn-m12-161">

<li id="cn-m12-161">It can be overloaded with more tasks if not secured properly. The overload of tasks may cause scheduling problems</li>

<li id="cn-m12-162">Can be attacked as there is no built-in security</li>

<li id="cn-m12-163">Can be prone to power drain attack in which the battery of a device is drained</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m12-164"><b>Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m12-165">A Real-Time Operating System (<b>RTOS</b>) is 
designed to work with the real-time applications that require instant 
results as soon as they make a request. Certain applications cannot use 
the buffer to store their requests for later and such need instant 
responses. Such applications are designed to work with the <b>RTOS</b>, which, without buffering the requests, processes the data on an immediate basis.  Some of the key examples are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m12-166">

<li id="cn-m12-166">Air Traffic Control&nbsp;Systems</li>

<li id="cn-m12-167">Networked Multimedia&nbsp;Systems</li>

<li id="cn-m12-168">Command Control&nbsp;Systems</li>

<li id="cn-m12-169">Military systems</li>

<li id="cn-m12-170">Automobiles</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m12-171">Just like any other system, <b>RTOS </b>is also prone to various vulnerabilities. Some key vulnerabilities are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m12-172">

<li id="cn-m12-172">Remote code execution</li>

<li id="cn-m12-173">Insecure permissions</li>

<li id="cn-m12-174">Privilege escalation</li>

<li id="cn-m12-175">Denial of Service (<b>DoS</b>)</li>

<li id="cn-m12-176">Buffer overflow</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m12-177">Most of these vulnerabilities can cause information leakage within <b>RTOS</b>.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m12-178"><b>System-on-Chip</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m12-179">A&nbsp;System-on-Chip (<b>SoC</b><span class="cn-9999999">), </span>is a platform in which an integrated circuit (<b>IC</b>)
 integrates various chips to function as a complete system. The entire 
system is integrated into one single chip that can include various 
components, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m12-180">

<li id="cn-m12-180">CPU</li>

<li id="cn-m12-181">Input and output ports</li>

<li id="cn-m12-182">Memory</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m12-183">Some of the key examples of <b>SOC </b>are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m12-184">

<li id="cn-m12-184">Smartphones</li>

<li id="cn-m12-185">Cameras</li>

<li id="cn-m12-186">Tablets</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m12-187">Various vulnerabilities can exist with <b>SOC</b>:</p>

<ul id="cn-m12-188">

<li id="cn-m12-188">Information leakage</li>

<li id="cn-m12-189">Physical tampering</li>

<li id="cn-m12-190">Side-channel attacks</li>

<li id="cn-m12-191">Reverse engineering</li>

<li id="cn-m12-192">Buffer issues</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m12-193"><b>Physical Access Control</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m12-194">Almost all organizations, small or large, will have 
some sort of physical access controls deployed. These physical access 
controls are designed to prevent several misuses of a physical 
environment.</p>

<p id="cn-m12-195">There can be different types of threats in the physical access control. Some of these threats are namely:</p>

<ul id="cn-m12-196">

<li id="cn-m12-196"><b>Abuses</b>: this is about forcing the doors to open. It is also the bypassing the access controls or picking the locks</li>

<li id="cn-m12-197"><b>Masquerading</b>: is using someone else’s security card to enter a door that has an access control system implemented.</li>

<li id="cn-m12-198"><b>Piggybacking</b>: is about the following someone 
without authenticating yourself or showing the security card. The entry 
is gained with the credentials of someone ahead of you.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m12-199"><b>Building Automation Systems</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m12-200">The building automation systems are automation 
methods that help you manage a building’s heating, ventilation, air 
conditioning (<b>HVAC</b>). The idea is to increase the efficiency in managing <b>HVAC</b>,
 reduce cost, and also reduce human dependency. There are different 
components of a building automation system, such as sensors, 
controllers, output devices, communication protocols, and a terminal 
interface. It is important to understand that each one of the components
 is controlled either by firmware or software.</p>

<p id="cn-m12-201">Just like any other software or automation systems, 
building automation systems are also prone to various vulnerabilities. 
Most of these vulnerabilities are the same as the other automation or 
software systems.</p>

<p id="cn-m12-202">Some common vulnerabilities found in building automation systems are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m12-203">

<li id="cn-m12-203">Buffer overflow</li>

<li id="cn-m12-204">Hardcoded secrets</li>

<li id="cn-m12-205">Device misconfigurations</li>

<li id="cn-m12-206">Cross-site scripting</li>

<li id="cn-m12-207">Path traversal</li>

<li id="cn-m12-208">Arbitrary file deletion</li>

<li id="cn-m12-209">Authentication bypass</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m12-210">Most of these vulnerabilities are pretty common with 
Web applications. It is not uncommon to have these vulnerabilities in 
the building automation systems as they can be managed by a Web 
application or a mobile app, which, if not tested for security, will 
have these vulnerabilities.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m12-211"><b>Autonomous Vehicles </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m12-212">An autonomous vehicle is a self-driven vehicle that 
does not require any human intervention. These are mostly known as 
driverless vehicles or rather driverless cars. The autonomous vehicles 
contain millions of lines of code, which is nearly impossible to make it
 bug-free. It can be estimated that there can be around 300 million 
lines of code.</p>

<p id="cn-m12-213">More lines of code can indeed lead to the possibility
 of introducing more bugs and security flaws, which can be exploited by 
the attackers. Moreover, in some cases, a smartphone app is used to 
control the autonomous vehicle, which itself can lead to several 
security flaws. For example, even if the code for the autonomous car is 
functional and bug-free, the attackers may exploit a vulnerability in 
the smartphone app that is controlling it.</p>

<p id="cn-m12-214">There can be various types of attacks that can be 
done on autonomous vehicles if there are bugs and vulnerabilities. 
Various components can be exploited, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m12-215">

<li id="cn-m12-215">Global Positioning System (<b>GPS</b>)</li>

<li id="cn-m12-216">External Networks, such as V2X Network</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m12-217">Attacks that can exploit various vulnerabilities are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m12-218">

<li id="cn-m12-218">Onboard diagnostics attack</li>

<li id="cn-m12-219">Engine Control Unit (<b>ECU</b>) Firmware tampering attack</li>

<li id="cn-m12-220">Rogue Updates</li>

<li id="cn-m12-221">Physical access to the <b>ECU</b></li>

<li id="cn-m12-222">Remote access</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m12-223"><b>Drones</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m12-224">A drone is a blanket term for an un-crewed aerial vehicle or <b>UAV</b>.
 It is a small aerial vehicle that is used for various purposes, such as
 surveillance. It can fly with a controlled flight plan and is 
controlled through sensors and <b>GPS</b>.</p>

<p id="cn-m12-225">A drone works with two different signals: rising and 
downlink signals. The rising signals are received by the drone. The 
rising signals can be in the form of radio command or <b>GPS </b>signals.
 However, these can be replaced by the lure signals that are sent by an 
attacker. The lure signals replace the rising signals to allow the 
attacker to take control of the drone.</p>

<p id="cn-m12-226">Downlink signals are sent by the drone. The signals 
may contain flight information or video transmission, both of which can 
be intercepted by an attacker. Video transmission is typically being 
transmitted in an unsecured manner that is susceptible to interception.</p>

<p id="cn-m12-227">Downlink and rising signals are not protected or 
rather encrypted. Therefore, both signals can be intercepted and allow 
the attacker to modify the transmission or take control.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m12-228"><b>Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m12-229">Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (<b>SCADA</b>) systems are known as the industrial control systems (<b>ICS</b>),
 which means that they have a specific purpose of providing 
supervisory-level control over industrial or machinery that is meant to 
serve a specific purpose. They are used for managing the machinery or 
its related system. An example use case of the <b>SCADA </b>system can be in the electrical domain, where <b>SCADA </b>systems manage the distribution of the electricity over a large geographical area.</p>

<p id="cn-m12-230"><b>SCADA </b>systems across the world have been 
attacked multiple times. The inherent vulnerabilities have been 
exploited. Some of the common vulnerabilities are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m12-231">

<li id="cn-m12-231"><b>Unmonitored systems</b>: <b>SCADA </b>systems are
 typically unmonitored. There are no active monitoring systems that 
perform continuous monitoring for suspicious activities. Since there is 
no continuous monitoring, it is difficult to detect an attack when it 
takes place.</li>

<li id="cn-m12-232"><b>Passwords</b>: Each <b>SCADA </b>system is built with some level of authentication. However, the human-errors lead to poor authentication with the <b>SCADA </b>systems.
 Humans tend to use poor and simple passwords or sharing of passwords, 
which leads to the compromise of the SCADA system authentication.</li>

<li id="cn-m12-233"><b>Poor update mechanism</b>: <b>SCADA </b>systems 
are large most of the time, and they should be updated with the latest 
firmware and software from time to time. However, the lack of poor 
update management also causes an issue as there can be inherent 
vulnerabilities with the software or firmware. Therefore, once these 
vulnerabilities are known to the attacker, he or she can easily exploit 
them.</li>

<li id="cn-m12-234"><b>Inadequate input validation</b>: <b>SCADA </b>system applications may need some type of user inputs. However, in some cases, such as WebAccess <b>SCADA </b>from Advantech did not validate the user input, which gave the attacker an opportunity to execute arbitrary code.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m12-235">There are different components of a <b>SCADA </b>system that can be a target for the attacker. Some of the key components are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m12-236">

<li id="cn-m12-236"><b>Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs</b>): Are used to 
present the data to the users after collecting it from various sensors. 
If not secured properly, they can be a target for the attackers.</li>

<li id="cn-m12-237"><b>Mobile and Web Applications</b>: <b>SCADA </b>systems
 can be either accessed using a mobile or a Web application. Just like 
in any industry, both the mobile and the Web application can have bugs, 
which can be exploited by the attackers.</li>

<li id="cn-m12-238"><b>Protocols</b>: <b>SCADA </b>systems use various 
protocols, such as Modbus and Profinet, which lacks a strong security 
mechanism. The data traveling over these protocols can be intercepted 
and altered by the attacker.</li>
